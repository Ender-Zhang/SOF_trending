unexpect output implement sgd algorithm ml homework part train data normal row dataset http first data preprocess implement algorithm like output run variou learn rate also tri converg threshold still got result could find code give nan anybodi see issu get overflow number code gradient basic get larg set consid take epoch much lower learn rate aka make algorithm converg abl get result learn rate see train set correct number could also monitor converg depend number epoch could also consid adapt learn rate schedul anoth note exactli sure equat correct sinc use way around might need updat weight intercept doubl minu mayb check comparison ps algorithm yet stochast
