A simple multiplication of two numbers that can both be either int or float : This function returns float , except in the case where both a and b are int . How can I properly and concisely annotate the return type? I know I can do this with @overload : but this is very verbose and requires many overloads for something I would imagine some "type function" should handle. In C++ this could be done e.g. with SFINAE . Is there something similar in Python?
