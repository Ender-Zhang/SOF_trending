I have an EditText in the lower part of my Android screen. Due to some project contraints I'm supposed to use only Absolute positioning. When clicked on the EditText the soft keyboard hides the Edit text. I have tried putting android:windowSoftInputMode="adjustResize" in the manifest file (also tried adjustPan) It only works for relative positioning (commented textField_layoutparams code below) but doesn't seems to be working for absolute positioning.
