I am trying to make this timeline where each keyframe happens after the previous one has finished. So far, each of the steps happen one after the other. However, the rotateBack keyframe starts rotating my object as soon as I play the animation. Any tips on how to make rotateBack only play right after moveToRight? Also, I would like for rotateBack to finish its rotation before moveToTop plays.
