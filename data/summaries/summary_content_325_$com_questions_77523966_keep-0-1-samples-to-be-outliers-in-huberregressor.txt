When I run Huber regression on a certain data set using HuberRegressor() form sklearn.linear_model , I want to keep 0.1% of all samples to be outliers. As I know, Huberregressor() controls the size of outliers by param epsilon , but the it doesn't support a percentage form, and my response variable does not come from a normal distribution. Further, is there a way to generally make such adjustments to models that use the huber loss function? Such as GLS+Huber or GBRT+.
