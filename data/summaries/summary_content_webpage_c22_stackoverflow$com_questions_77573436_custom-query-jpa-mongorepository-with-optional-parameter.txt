I am using JPA MongoRepository interface and writing a Custom Query. But for example when call http://localhost:8080/ and http://127:0x8080?state=1 is always return me Ticket[]. Comparing with PL/SQL I need something like What is wrong in my @Query definition ? After one day on possible workaround's I found other implementation. For a better control on Mongo query and operations I switch from Mongo repository to Mongo template.
