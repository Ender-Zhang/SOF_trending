I wanted to code a pixel tracker for emails to see if they have been read or not. To do this, I set up a Flask app and kept it running through my terminal on Mac and waiting for input. However, even when the test email was read, nothing was printed or returned to both the terminal and the localhost browser. It must be a problem with gmail itself.
