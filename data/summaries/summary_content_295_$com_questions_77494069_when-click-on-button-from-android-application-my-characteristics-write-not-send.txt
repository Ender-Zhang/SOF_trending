The data I received correctly from the server is below. I have an Android app with a user interface containing a button. On button click, I initiate a write operation to a specific BLE characteristic associated with the ESP32 server to transmit data. However, despite the code being implemented to write data to the characteristic, the data isn't successfully transmitted.
