I'm trying to implement the SDE solver called ESRK1 and the adaptive stepsize algorithm called RSwM1 from Rackauckas & Nie (2017) I'm writing a python implementation, mainly to confirm to myself that I've understood the algorithm correctly. I believe this algorithm is implemented as part of the library DifferentialEquations.jl in Julia, so I thought perhaps I could find some help by looking at the Julia code.
