In my Java android SDK I'm getting the subscription ID as follows and then sending it to my backend where im storing these subscription IDs in my DB but it doesnt seem to work when I try to send a notification using This is my node js API code snippet. The OneSignal ID is UUID generated by One signal to represent a user. The ID will always be associated with a Subscription ID.
