The Set returned by getAllThings() will reflect any changes made within my registry. However, the Set. returned bygetAllThingsWithProperty() will not reflect these changes. Is there any way using standard java libraries, or some incredibly common third party library, to make the return value of get all things to be a "live" sub Set? I.E. it "backed by" the original Set but reapplies the Predicate each time its accessed.
