I want to connect the dots that make up one stroke of a letter with a straight line so that words can be drawn. I tried to draw them using drawLine but it's not what i really wanted. This is my code: Drag (multiple shapes) Connected lines Disconnected lines Some notes Don't use Vector , use ArrayList , you probably won't notice it, but ArrayList will be faster The Graphics 2D API already has a Point class, don't re-invent the wheel.
