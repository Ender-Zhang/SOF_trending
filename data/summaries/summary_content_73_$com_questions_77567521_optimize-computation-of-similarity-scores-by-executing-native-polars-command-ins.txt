The input dataset is the ratings.csv from the ml-latest dataset of 80_000 IMDb movies and respective ratings from 330_000 users (you may download the CSV file from here - 891mb). I load the dataset using polars like movie_ratings = pl.read_csv(os.path.join(application_path + data_directory, "ratings.csv") , application_path and data_ directory is a parent path on my local server. Having read the dataset my goal is to generate the cosine similarity of a user between all the other users.
