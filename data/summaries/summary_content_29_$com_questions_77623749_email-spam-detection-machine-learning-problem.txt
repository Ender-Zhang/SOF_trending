I copied someone's code from online for an email spam detector and tried to run it using Jupyter notebook. On the website of the person I copied the code from, the person had the same last line as me and when he ran it, it showed around 99% accuracy. But when I run it,. it gives me a .5% accuracy consistently. Can someone tell me what I am doing wrong with this program?
