Pagination is performed using two queries: first query will count a total size, second query returns actual records using two parameters: pageNumber and pageSize. These two queries are independent of each other and cannot be joined. It is possible to achieve the pagination in one call with $facet . Just be reminded not to have too large page size since it would fail due to 16MB MongoDB document size limit.
