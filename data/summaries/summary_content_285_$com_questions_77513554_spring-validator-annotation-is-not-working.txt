In my request body I am passing parameter in different way to validate. Here the operation is executing which I want to restrict with my custom error message. In my controller I had Which is working fine but Now I remove that and Using validator annotation. Can anybody tell me how to fix that as I am following this from here Doc @seenukarthi is actually correct. You have to use @Valid on the endpoint to valid the request body. Note: The validation errors are not visible in the error response. The error will appear in the console log.
