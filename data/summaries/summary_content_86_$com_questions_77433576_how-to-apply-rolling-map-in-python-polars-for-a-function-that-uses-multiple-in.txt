I have a function using Polars Expressions to calculate the standard deviation of the residuals from a linear regression. Now I would like to apply this function using a rolling window over a dataframe. My approaches below fail because I don't know how to pass two columns as arguments to the function. Is there a way to do this directly in Polars, or do I need to use a workaround with Pandas?
