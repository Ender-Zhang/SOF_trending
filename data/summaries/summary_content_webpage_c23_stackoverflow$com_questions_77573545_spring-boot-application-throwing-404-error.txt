The issue you're facing is likely due to the fact that when you use @ Controller and return a String , Spring expects that to be the name of a view, not the actual response. Since you are returning "This is open" as a String, Spring is trying to find a view with that name, and it's resulting in a 404 because there's no corresponding view. If you want to return a plain text response, you can use @Rest Controller instead of @ Controller.
