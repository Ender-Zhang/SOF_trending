I have a Java program that communicates with various devices to retrieve data via serial communication. I'm using the jSerialComm library for this purpose. When I retrieve data from a particular device using this Java program, the data appears to be corrupted. Surprisingly, when I use a C# program without any external libraries to retrieveData from the same device, theData is received correctly, without any corruption.
