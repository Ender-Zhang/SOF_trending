I have a spring boot application running on GCP Compute Engine. This application reads from Google Pub/Sub and after computation writes to Firestore and BigQuery. Another process also reads from BigQuery then computes its results. Once a week BigQuery operations stops and after at least 24 hours operations returns to normal. In these problematic situations no exceptions or timeout errors can be found.
