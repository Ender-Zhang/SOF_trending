I'm working on a C# application that involves rendering images onto a PictureBox. The images are 640x640 pixels in size, and I'm drawing them onto a destination of the same size. To optimize rendering performance and prioritize speed over image quality, I've tried setting the Interpolation Mode to Interpolated Mode.NearestNeighbor. However, I haven't observed any noticeable change in rendering speed or image quality.
