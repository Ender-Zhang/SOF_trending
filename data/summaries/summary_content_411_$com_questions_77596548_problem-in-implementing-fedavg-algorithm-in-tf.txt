I am implementing FL using TF in google colab ( not using TFF), I am using Bot-IoT datasets and I divide the data into 10 clients such that each client take all types of classes so it can train on all classes. The problem that I face is in the aggregation of the received model weights from each client to get the global accuracy and recall which is 0% in my code.
