I am trying to make an app for electric vehicle drivers and i'm using a text file to store the data. The way it works is i have the name of the electric vehicle and the the line under the name contains the miles it can get per 1%, i've got it so it can find the specific car but i can't find the range of the vehicle using that number. I'd suggest to read the file into a dictionary, then use that dictionary to find the car.
