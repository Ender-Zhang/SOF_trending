I'm trying to build an NLP model that uses XGBoost. My model detects whether a text document is fraudulent or real. I have a dataset thats labelled for fraudulent data. I understand that when transforming data, vectorizer and pca should both be fitted to our whole dataset. What I dont understand is, how do I make it such that, I can transform user input, and have it the same shape as my model that I pretrained? Whats the proper procedure for this?
