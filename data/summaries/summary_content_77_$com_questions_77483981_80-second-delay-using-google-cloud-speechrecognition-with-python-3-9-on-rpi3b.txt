I'm using the PyPi code ( https://pypi.org/project/SpeechRecognition/ ) cleaned up to use only Google Cloud Speech Recognition. Google Json Credentials in shell's environment, and working. I've enabled the Cloud Speech-to-Text API, got the Json credentials, and the service calls ARE hitting the API. However, its taking fully 80 seconds to perform the API call. How can I speed this up? Can it be slow-authentication handshake that I might mend?
