I have access to two AWS environments - one is my own company's sandbox environment, and the other is a GovCloud environment for an agency that I support. My team and I have been having issues in successfully importing Python modules using Lambda layers in the latter environment, but have no issues in the former. I've tried with a variety of runtimes and .zip file structures, but continue to encounter errors.
