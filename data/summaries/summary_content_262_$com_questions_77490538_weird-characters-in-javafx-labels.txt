I'm having some problems with JavaFX, basically I create my Labels by code. The problem is, my labels have strange characters where they should be accented letters. I've already set the IDE to UTF-8 and I've also tried converting the formatting of the string to see if I could fix it, but it didn't work. Solution: You must make sure that The Java source files in your editor are saved using Unicode.
