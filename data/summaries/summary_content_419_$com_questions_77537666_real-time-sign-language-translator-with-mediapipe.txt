So, i'm making a sign language translator with mediapipe. It works fine till i hold up both of my hands, it gives the following error: "X has 84 features, but RandomForestClassifier is expecting 42 features as input" I've tried tons of different solutions but none of them have worked so far. Any of you guys have any idea on how to fix my problem?
