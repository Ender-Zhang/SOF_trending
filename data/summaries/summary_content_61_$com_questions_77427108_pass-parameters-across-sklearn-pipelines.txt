I am writing a custom sklearn pipeline as follows: Step 1: Step 2: The pipeline is: In Step1, there is a parameter: 'some_param' that is fitted/defined somehow and that I want to use in Step2. I tried set_param but the behaviour was not as expected Brainstorming Idea: If these parameters are not random variables (not changed/updated in each run), parameters can be retrieved by fitting step 1 before the pipeline runs.
