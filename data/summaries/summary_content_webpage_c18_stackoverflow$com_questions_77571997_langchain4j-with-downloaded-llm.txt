I am exploring Langchain4j. I want to use it to interact with the downloaded model locally. I have downloaded stable-diffusion model from Huggingface using this command: How can I use LangChain4j(with stable- Diffusion) to create an Image in my local?Does Langchain 4j have that capability currently?
