I'm following an Amazon Sagemaker workshop to try and leverage several of Sagemaker's utilities instead of running everything off a Notebook. In the workshop they teach you how to use HyperparameterTuner using the ready-made XGBoost image from AWS. My problem is that I haven't found ANY information on how to access the hyperparameters passed in the SKLearn estimator inside the "train.py" file. Can someone tell if that's even possible, or offer alternatives if there's another easier way to do this?
