I'm struggling for quite some time now to save a small image in a database and load it to be used as a javafx.scene.image. Several solutions that I tried involved using SwingFXUtils.fromFXImage and SwingFX Utils.toFxImage, but it appears that the class requires an entry in the module-info.java file. This is not true. Although JavaFX only supports being loaded as named modules 1 , nothing about JavaFX requires that your own code be modular.
