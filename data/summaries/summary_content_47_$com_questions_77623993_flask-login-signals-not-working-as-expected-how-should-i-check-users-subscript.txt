I am unable to use Flask-Login 's signals as they are described. I am under the assumption that every time a user logged in, whether from a cookie or not, the user_logged_in signal would be called. I can only trigger it on a fresh login however. I need this functionality to check against a user's subscription to redirect them if they try accessing content they could previously access.
