I'm building a multi- module spring boot project with a structure similar to I define an interface in the core project, An interface. I also have an abstract Entity class in module, AbstractEntity. In the appplication package I have the SubEntity. As I understand the error, DevTools uses two class loaders. One for the app, and then one for all the dependencies, of which core and module are.
