For my scientific experiments, I usually seed using: rng = np.random.Generator(np.PCG64(seed) which for the current numpy version is equivalent to rng. Default to using a 128-bit integer using entropy gathered from the OS. This is a good amount of entropy to initialize all of the generators that we have in numpy. We do not recommend using small seeds below 32 bits for general use.
