I am working on displaying of user's profile and it's editing. On my page, if you click on "edit profile", you will be redirected to form with valueas as firstName, lastName, etc. and finally birthday. In that edit form, you should not see blank rows, but you should see filled in all the data from your profile, that are in database. And it is working, only the birthday is not shown! The value of birthday is blank in the form, despite it's saved in DB.
