In v8 / Node.js in particular, when you push a primitive type (string, number, boolean) into an array, does it clone the string, or store a reference? I know you can't do this and change the string: But if I do this, is it copying the string multiple times (thereby increasing the memory footprint)? Same question for object keys: If I push a key, will itclone the string? I searched around a bit but didn't find a direct answer.
