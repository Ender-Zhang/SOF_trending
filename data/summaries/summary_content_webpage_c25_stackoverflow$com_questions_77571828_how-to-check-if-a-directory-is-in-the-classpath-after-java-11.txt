Is there a direct way to check if a directory is in the classpath in Java 11? I have the situation that I want to migrate a project from Java 8 to Java 11. I have Code that performs a check to see if a certain directory is on the class path. This is how it looks: This seems pretty straightforward to me, and it works. However, The Class loader no longer has URLClassLoader as a base class. This makes the code completely unusable, since it heavily relies on this function.
