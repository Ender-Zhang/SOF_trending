On Android 13+ , it shows the grant permission , i allow it and then when i try to read or write text files from/to: It doesn't work. What I find even more confusing is that i have some code that writes a png image of the application , is working , but not the writing to text file portion. Also another thing that I find difficult to understand is that in android studio if i have a android 13 or 14 emulator , it works, but not on the real phone.
