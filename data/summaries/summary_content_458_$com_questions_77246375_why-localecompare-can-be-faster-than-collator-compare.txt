I have read multiple articles and comments, saying that the usage of Intl.Collator is beneficial in terms of performance while comparing strings. EcmaScript documentation states that localeCompare is just using Collator under the hood, but it might create the new Collator instance per each function call. I have tested the performance of both options and the results are surprising.
