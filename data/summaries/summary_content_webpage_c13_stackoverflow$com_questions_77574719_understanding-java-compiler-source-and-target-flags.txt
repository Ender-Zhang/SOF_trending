The javac documentation says: --source release or -source releaseCompiles source code according to the rules of the Java programming language for the specified Java SE release. But Maven says: setting the source option does not guarantee that your code actually compiles on a JDK with the specified version. Which of the above is correct? Or, can anyone explain with an example how both are correct?
