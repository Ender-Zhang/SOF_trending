I am trying to setup IntelliJ and maven project on multiple machines. I used Powershell to programmatically install Intellij on the machines and download the mavenproject repo. I also programmatically downloaded JDK and set JAVA_HOME to point to it. When I open the mven project in Intelli J, the default project SDK is not set. I need to manually go to Project Structure > Project Settings > Project and then point to the installed JDK on the machine.
