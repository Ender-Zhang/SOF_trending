I am using Jersey to stream "chunked" output, and my client wishes to read and display partial results as they are streamed. As described in https://stackoverflow.com/a/34358215/2452569 , I have to add a configuration value to my server config like so. This Jersey server is part of a large commercial application that, up until now, just didn't have any endpoints that required this kind of streaming.
