I am trying to use European Commission-sponsored Digital Signature Service (DSS) library 5.12.1 to validate electronic signatures. The code I am using is indicated in the dss-documentation PDF. My application always gets the INDETERMINATE indication with subindication NO_CERTIFICATE_CHAIN_FOUND (visible in the Certificate element of the CertificateChain) It doesn't find the trust anchors. What I am doing wrong?
