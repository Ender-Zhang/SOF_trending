After running a code scanning on my project, I see the CWE-918 vulnerability, but in the code, the parameters are retrieved from application.properties , so I am unsure how to solve this issue or even if it is an actual issue. If these properties are read from a configuration file that the end-user (and thus, also the attacker) can't access, there is no vulnerability here. To state it differently - if an attacker needs to gain access to a local file on your server in order to change  the settings, this is not a vulnerability.
