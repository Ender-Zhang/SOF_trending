One of the concrete classes does not need validation, so it implements the abstract method performValidations as an empty void method. Is this violating the Interface Segregation Principle? Or would it be OK in this situation to leave the implementation of this abstract method in the concrete class empty? What you have implemented is also known as hook in Template Method design pattern.
