I am trying to use European Commission-sponsored Digital Signature Service (DSS) library 5.12.1 to validate electronic signatures of the digitally signed PDF-s and XML-s. The code I am using is indicated in the dss-documentation PDF. My application always gets the INDETERMINATE indication with subindication NO_CERTIFICATE_CHAIN_FOUND (visible in the Certificate element of the CertificateChain). It doesn't find the trust anchors. When I use the sample application 5.12.1 for signature validation and try to validate the same document, I get the expected TOTAL_PASSED indication. My app has internet access. What I am doing wrong?
Thanks! There's a difference between the sample app and your code. The sample app comes with a pre-configured list of trusted roots (EU LOTL). Your code comes with an empty CommonTrustedCertificateSource (i.e., no certificate is trusted) See the DSS FAQ When validating a signature I receive INDETERMINATE/NO_CERTIFICATE_CHAIN_FOUND indication The result means the validator was not able to reach a trust anchor when validating the certificate chain of the signature. More likely the issue is caused by the fact you have not configured a trusted certificate source within the used CertificateVerifier. To do it, you need to add trust anchors to the instance of CertificateVerifier you use within DocumentValidator: So you need to add some certificates to the CommonTrustedCertificateSource . If you're only verifying signatures created by yourself, add your CA root/your signing certificate to the trusted source. If you're verifying third-party signatures, the solution is more complex. For example, you could extract all certificated from a PDF and add them to the trusted list before validation
