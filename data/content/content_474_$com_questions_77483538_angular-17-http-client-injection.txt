I am building a new app for testing with angular 17 trying to connect to a simple API rest. I am desperate to get this to work. I have asked chat GPT, reviewed stack's older posts and even download an old application, but with no success. Here is my app config and the error: app.module.ts app-routing.module.ts cliente.service.ts cliente.component.ts The problem is this: You are mixing Modules and Standalone Components. As of Angular 17 everything is standalone by default, unless you specify otherwise. You have 2 options. Don't use stand alone components, make your components part of modules, then the import arrays in the modules should work. Work without modules and make the app completely standalone. As intended from Angular 17 If you started a project in angular 17, I suggest against option number one. For start, go to main.js and add provideHttpClient(withFetch()) to the providers array. Insted of importing HttpClientModule in your AppModule. Anyhow, adding provideHttpClient() to the default appConfig providers list solves the same problem for me. So the default src/app/app.config.ts looks like this. Even though I don't have an answer to how that works underneath, @vbartalis' reply makes sense as it seems to me. In your appcomponent.ts add HttpClientModule to the imports array after the styleUrls array. It works for me Using standalone components allows you to use the component like a module, so put your service inside the " @component{ " inside of "providers: [service]". Exactly the same way as you would in a module example:
