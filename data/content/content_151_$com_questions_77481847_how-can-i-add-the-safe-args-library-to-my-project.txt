I want to add the Safe Args library to my project using Java. I add these in Android Studio, and it downloads and adds them automatically. But when I try to add these to my project Android Studio doesn't reach the download stage and encounters an error I've been dealing with this issue for a while. Thank you in advance. I handed the project to someone else for testing, and it worked correctly for them. I don't know why I'm encountering this issue.
