A HashMap<Integer, Integer> has 10 entries but I only want to print 3 entries. Code: Output Expecting output: Why is the if-condition inside while-loop is not working? You don't exit out of the loop once i becomes 4. Also, you don't consume/read the subsequent elements from the iterator as itr.next() is inside the if block. So, it keeps incrementing i until it overflows to Integer.MIN_VALUE (-2147483648) and this takes a few seconds (which you have observed). At this point the condition of the if block becomes true ( i < n ) and hence it starts printing the other elements from the iterator. You can print the value of i to see this. Prints, When i reaches n the if condition will become false and i will be incremented indefinitely whereas the iterator will not step to the next. At some point i starts to be smaller than n due to number overflow (but a lot of while iterations are passed without going to the next in the meantime) and then your loop ends in an undesired manner. You will need or change somehow the condition of your loop so it will not continue its work when it no longer makes sense. You must move out of if the iter.next(), so the solution is: OUTOUT is:
