Im facing issue, where imageview is getting pushed out by inner linear layout. The views are wrapped inside an outer linear layout. I tried a constraint layout chaining, but the view needed a constraint from left and right side, which resulted in aligning the view into the center, which is not desired. I want the view, to be aligned to the left side. Does anybody know? To pin the view to the left in a constraint layout you can use the See detailed answer . That way you can have constraints with left and right but the view would stick to the left.
