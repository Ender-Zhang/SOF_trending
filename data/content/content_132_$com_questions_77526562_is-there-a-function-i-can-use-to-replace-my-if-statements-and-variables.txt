I'm trying to figure out how to make my code more readable and have less lines in my code. It contains a lot of if elif statements that seem like can be combined into a few. I tried getting rid of the variables on the top by putting fl == fl.endswith(".filetype") inside of the if statements, and instead of printing each type it only printed my else statement. I also tried looking up other ways to get the end of the str in python docs but couldn't find anything. Don't give me too direct of a solution to the problem, would like to avoid cs50 academic honesty issues. Also still quite new to python Use a dictionary to map extensions to content-types. You can use a dictionary: It's probably better to use existing mimetypes package than maintaining a custom mapping result Probably easiest/cleanest to create a dictionary that maps file extensions to content types: I would make a dictionary to store the different file types as keys and their respective outputs that you want to print as values. You can then just check if: And then print the corresponding key from the dictionary. "... I'm trying to figure out how to make my code more readable and have less lines in my code. ..." Ideally, you'll want to categorize the data, into components. Output Although, I recommend utilizing the mimetypes module; specifically, the types_map dictionary . Output If you want brevity: The get method will look up the dict and fallback to the default of octet-stream if it can't find a match.
