I am trying to understand my XGBoost model using shap. To the model I feed data in form of a dataframe with most columns having either -1,0,1 as values. 1 column has numerical values. Code looks like this: The model works perfectly when trying to predict new values. when trying explainer_buy = shap.TreeExplainer(buy_xgb) I get following error: I already tried it with less estimators (20k). Still doesnt work. Any idea on how to solve?
