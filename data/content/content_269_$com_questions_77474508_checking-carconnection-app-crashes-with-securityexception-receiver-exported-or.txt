in Android 34, App crashes with SecurityException: com.mgg.timmi: One of RECEIVER_EXPORTED or RECEIVER_NOT_EXPORTED should be specified when a receiver isn't being registered exclusively for system broadcasts . This crash happens when calling in Android 34 Observer and Oberserverable are deprecated, so what else can I use to check if device is connected with Android Car . I'm using implementation car.app:1.2.0 . thanks
GGK For apps that target API 34 or higher running on an API 34 or higher device, you'll need to use 1.3.0-beta01 or higher as described at https://developer.android.com/training/cars/apps#car-connection .
