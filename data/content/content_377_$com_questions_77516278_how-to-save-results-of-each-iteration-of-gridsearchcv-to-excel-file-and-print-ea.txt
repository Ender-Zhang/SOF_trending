I have code to make GridSearchCV for tuning of hyperparameters in LSTM in Python like below: And I have 2 questions: How to save results of each combinations of hyperparameters to Excel file. I would like to have in that file: number of iteration, hyperparameters used in that iteration, average AUC from 5 folds How to print in each iteration: number of iteration, hyperparameters used in that iteration, average AUC from 5 folds How can I modify my code in Python ?
