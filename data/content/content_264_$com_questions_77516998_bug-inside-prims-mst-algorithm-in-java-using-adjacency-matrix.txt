I'm trying implement Prim's Minimum Spanning Tree Algorithm of a graph represented using Adjacency Matrix in Java. The code is running successfully, but not able to generate expected output. The Algorithm only selects the first vertex and doesn't move forward. What am I doing wrong? Here is my implementation of the Algorithm. Here is my main function call: I tried running the code, this is my output: I'm getting 0-1 repeatedly (i.e not progressing from start vertex)
