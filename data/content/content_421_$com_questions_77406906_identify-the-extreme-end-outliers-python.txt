I have many data frames below are the samples but in actuality, they are huge in size - one sample - df_all Seller Date Sales EWC 2-Aug-2023 26 EWC 3-Aug-2023 27 EWC 4-Aug-2023 40 EWC 5-Aug-2023 50 EWC 6-Aug-2023 60 EWC 7-Aug-2023 76 EWC 8-Aug-2023 106 EWC 9-Aug-2023 126 EWC 12-Aug-2023 1212126 EWC 13-Aug-2023 626 Another sample - df_all Seller Date Sales BMW 2-Aug-2023 1 BMW 3-Aug-2023 1 BMW 4-Aug-2023 1 BMW 5-Aug-2023 1 BMW 6-Aug-2023 2 BMW 7-Aug-2023 2 BMW 8-Aug-2023 2 BMW 9-Aug-2023 2 BMW 12-Aug-2023 15 BMW 13-Aug-2023 20 Here I have 2 seller examples.
EWC on 12th Aug its sales value is 1212126 which is an extreme outlier.
BMW On 12th and 13th Aug its value is 15 and 20 which is not an extreme outlier. I am using the below code but it is also showing BMW 15 and 20 values as outliers, which is not required. I only need to identify the extreme outliers. Try this: Another idea for you: You can change quantile size for determine threshhold.
