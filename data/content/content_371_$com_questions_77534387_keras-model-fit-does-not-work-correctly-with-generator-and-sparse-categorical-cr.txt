tf.keras.Model.fit(x=generator) does not work correctly with SparseCategoricalCrossentropy / sparce_categorical_crossentropy loss function with a generator as training data. The same symptom reported in Accuracy killed when using ImageDataGenerator TensorFlow Keras . Please advise if this behaviour is as expected or please point out if code is incorrect. Code excerpt. Entire code at the bottom. Symptom Using Sparse Index as the labels and SparseCategoricalCrossentropy as the loss function ( USE_SPARSE_LABEL=True ). The accuracy values got unstable and low, causing early stop. Using One Hot Encoding as the labels and CategoricalCrossentropy as the loss function ( USE_SPARSE_LABEL=True ). Work as expected. Code Environment Workaround The answer by innat worked. The behaviour that is found with metrics=["accuracy"] for using sparse target vectors seems like a potential bug in the API. According to the doc , the string identifier accuracy should be converted to appropriate loss instance. When you pass the strings accuracy or acc , we convert this to one of tf.keras.metrics.BinaryAccuracy , tf.keras.metrics.CategoricalAccuracy , tf.keras.metrics.SparseCategoricalAccuracy based on the shapes of the targets and of the model output In you case, you need to use keras.metrics.SparseCategoricalAccuracy(name='accuracy') specifically to make it work.
