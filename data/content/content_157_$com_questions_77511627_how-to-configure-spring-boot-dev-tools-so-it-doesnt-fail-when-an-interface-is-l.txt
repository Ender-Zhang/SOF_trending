I keep getting errors with the RestartClassLoader including I'm building a multi-module spring boot project with a structure similar to I define an interface in the core project, AnInterface. I also have an abstract Entity class in module, AbstractEntity. In the appplication package I have the SubEntity As I understand the error, DevTools uses two class loaders. One for the app, and then one for all the dependencies, of which core, and module are. AnInterface gets loaded by both causing 2 different versions of AnInterface. From what I understand there are ways to have RestartClassLoader include or exclude classes/sources/jars but I'm having issues with the placement and syntax. The only way I can bypass the exception is to add a system property in my main class If I put spring.devtools.restart.enabled=false into application.properties it doesn't appear to do anything. I also tried creating a spring-devtools.properties in the same folder as application.properties which didn't fix it either. While this gets me to be able to continue developing, losing the ability for devtools to restart the application is slowing me down. How can I configure devtools restartClassLoader to avoid this collission? The best I could figure out it has something to do with setting in application.properties a property like but that hasn't worked for me and neither did putting it in the main class as It feels like I'm close, what am I missing to be able to get devtools restart working again?
