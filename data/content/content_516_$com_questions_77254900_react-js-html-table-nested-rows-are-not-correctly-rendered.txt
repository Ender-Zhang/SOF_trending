I'm facing an issue with rendering the table data. There are a total of four columns and the last two columns can also contain nested rows. But facing a problem rendering this behavior How can I achieve this via the HTML table element in React.js? Please see the screenshot as an example: Code: You can use the rowspan attribute on the td element. It makes the cell span across multiple table rows. For you case you need to add td with rowspan in the first row for each "product", and other rows for this product would have first 2 td elements omitted.
