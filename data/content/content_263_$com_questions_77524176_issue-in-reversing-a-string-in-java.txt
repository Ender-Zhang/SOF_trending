cant reverse my string using char[] array
if my input is geeks and output shpuld be skeeg
if i reverse using charAt function it reverse the string correctly if i use the reverse[i]=reverse[j] i cant reverse it properly where (j=length of reverse)  for clear view please view my code .
the above code gives me output as wrong for example if my input is geeks it gives output as skeks
if i change the line reverseword[j] = reverseword[i]; to reverseword[j] = test.charAt(i); it gives coorect output.
since reversedword also contains the same word but it gives issue while reversing a string but when using test.chatAt it works?
whats the issue in reversing a string using reverseword[j] = reverseword[i];? In your code, you are trying to read and write data in the same array at the same time, which is causing data loss. When you start reading data from the end of the array and write it to the beginning of the array, you are actually overwriting the original data.To fix this, you need to create a new array to store the reversed characters, so you're not overwriting the original characters. However, when you use the charAt , you are reading the original string, which has not been modified the entire process. So you can correctly take the character from the end of the string. Your code has two algorithmic problems: reverseword[j] = reverseword[i]; overwrites the character at index j and leaves the char at i as is. You can use a temporary variable to swap these two values; by running the for loop from reverseword.length - 1 to 0 , even if you use a temporary variable, you are going to swap them correctly, but you are going to do it twice and end up with the initial array. Below is a code that fixes it (and adds another way of reversing a string):
