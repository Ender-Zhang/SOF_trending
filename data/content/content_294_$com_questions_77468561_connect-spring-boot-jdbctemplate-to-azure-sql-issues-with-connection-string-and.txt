I cannot seem to connect my Java Spring Boot Project to Azure SQL with JDBCTemplate. I keep getting errors, both through Autowired, with connection string, and Option 2) Setting Data Source manually. How can I resolve this issue?
However, both options work with localhost sql database on my computer. Error: The TCP/IP connection to the host
tcp:food-server.database.windows.net, port 1433 has failed.
Error: "tcp:food-server.database.windows.net. Verify the
connection properties. Make sure that an instance of SQL Server is
running on the host and accepting TCP/IP connections at the port. Make
sure that TCP connections to the port are not blocked by a firewall." Option 1) @Autowired with connectionString in application.properties file, not working Option 2) Configuration Beans with DataSource, currently not working either Azure IP Security Settings: I also made sure to allow my IP Address in Azure SQL Portal, database, Set Firewall https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/azure-sql/database/firewall-create-server-level-portal-quickstart?view=azuresql The TCP/IP connection to the host tcp:food-server.database.windows.net, port 1433 has failed.

As @tgdavies commented, the URL you have provided is not in the correct format, which may be the reason you are getting this error. " tcp: in your host name should be removed " in your URL.You can provide the URL in the following format: By doing this, you should be able to connect to the database successfully. For more information, you can refer to the MS Document on how to prepare a configuration file to connect to Azure SQL database.
