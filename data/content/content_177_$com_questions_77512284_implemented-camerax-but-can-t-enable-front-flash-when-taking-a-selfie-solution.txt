I implemented CameraX but can’t enable front flash when taking a selfie. However my stock camera app is working well but CameraX is not. Did anybody face a similar issue before? I implemented CameraX but can’t enable front flash when taking a selfie. Use below: You have to give 1 in your getCameraIdList. As getCameraIdList() accepts 2 values, 0 for back camera and 1 for front camera. It worked for me.
