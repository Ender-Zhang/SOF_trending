I have a transformer model that needs to output three different labels. Loss is computed on out_1, out_5 and out_4 separately and combined. But in essence I expect out_1, out_2 and out_3 to have the same shape but different values. When I print them post training I get different values on the training set i.e If I did this I get different values for the training set (which is my expectation as the losses for each of these branches are different) but when I do the same on validation and test set I get exactly the same values for all of these. How is this possible? What am I doing incorrectly here?
