I’m trying to import data into SQL through Python, and I'm using pyodbc and TensorFlow in Python 3.12, but TensorFlow doesn’t work. I can’t use python 3.11 because pyodbc isn’t compatible with it. I tried using pip install tensorflow , and I got this error: ERROR: Could not find a version that satisfies the requirement tensorflow (from versions: none) ERROR: No matching distribution found for tensorflow How do I fix this while staying in Python 3.12? It seems that TensorFlow is now only available up to version 3.11 of Python. Install TensorFlow 2 While I don't find any information that pyodbc isn't compatible with Python 3.11. You may use Python 3.11 and try again. pyodbc ( PyPI )
