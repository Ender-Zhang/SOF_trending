In developer tools for Chrome, the legend displays perfectly on top of a mapbox map for desktop, tablet and mobile.  Here is what is looks like.  It displays a semitransparent horizontal legend. If I actually use my iPhone though, the legends displays incorrectly.  It becomes vertical and all formatting appears lost. Here is my mapbox control: Why doesn't this work? Wow, it was as simple as [this].  While the mobile version in developer tools in Chrome displayed correct, it did not display correctly on my mobile.  I deleted chrome on my cell and reinstalled it and it worked.  This is the solution also used in the link provided.  No idea why though. I deleted chrome on my cell and reinstalled it and it worked One side effect of that reinstallation would be to benefit from a cleared cache, allowing the browser to fetch the latest version of the webpage and its associated files. And that can also include the latest version, updating it to a newer version where such bugs were fixed. Check also if there was any extension in your previous Chrome installation which have been removed during that reinstallation process: those could have  interfered with the webpage rendering. When your Mapbox legend is working on desktop and tablet but not on mobile devices, there are a few potential issues to consider and steps you can take to troubleshoot and fix the problem: Responsive CSS: Ensure that your CSS styles are responsive and mobile-friendly. Check if there are specific styles applied to the legend that might be causing layout issues on smaller screens. Use media queries to adjust styles for different screen sizes. Viewport Settings: Verify the meta viewport tag in the  section of your HTML. Make sure it's properly configured to ensure the correct rendering of the web page on mobile devices. Javascript Errors: Check your browser's developer console for any JavaScript errors specific to mobile devices. These errors might be causing the legend not to render properly. Addressing these errors can resolve the issue. Browser Compatibility: Test the map and legend on multiple mobile browsers (such as Chrome, Safari, Firefox) to see if the issue persists across different platforms. Sometimes, browser-specific CSS or JavaScript inconsistencies can cause problems. Mapbox Libraries: Ensure that you are using the latest version of the Mapbox JavaScript library. Older versions might have compatibility issues with certain mobile devices. Update the library to the latest version to benefit from bug fixes and improvements. Legend Markup: Double-check the HTML markup and CSS styles for the legend. It's possible that the legend elements are not structured properly for mobile devices. Simplify the legend design if needed, focusing on basic HTML and CSS to ensure compatibility. By addressing these points and testing your application on various mobile devices and browsers, you should be able to identify and resolve the issue causing the Mapbox legend not to display correctly on mobile devices.
