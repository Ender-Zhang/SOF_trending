Dear Spring/Spring Security developers: For this controller method in Spring Boot, I use PreAuthorize annotation in combination with hasPermission Method. My problem is how to pass the Enum value currectly to the hasPermission method using SpEL. I get the this error: Unsatisfied dependency expressed through constructor parameter 0: No qualifying bean of type 'java.lang.String' available First, an enum class cannot be instantiated externally, so do not attempt to register an enum as a Spring bean. Moreover, Spring is unable to assist you in finding a constructor parameter of type String. Second, there is an error in your EL expression. Therefore, the final solution is to remove @Component and change the EL expression to @PreAuthorize("hasPermission(#authentication, T(yourEnumPackageName.ScopeEnum).UPDATE.name)") .
