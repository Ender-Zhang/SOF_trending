I have this /app/auth/login/route.ts And the page which is on /app/login/page.tsx Those were the codes that I got from the documentation. I am, however, unable to implement where it displays that they have successfully logged in and the error handling. I followed answers below, however, I am receiving this error: POST http://localhost:3000/auth/login net::ERR_ABORTED 405 (Method Not> Allowed) route.ts api/login/page.tsx I see you did implement a route handler for the /auth/login endpoint in Next.js, but in your first snippet, you have defined a function named POST . In the second snippet, you have renamed this function to handler . It would be clearer to use the same name for this function across both snippets. Since you get a 405, I suppose the server configuration or the route handler not being set up correctly to handle POST requests to this endpoint. First, make sure the file name of your route handler matches the URL path you are trying to handle. For example, if your route handler is in a file named route.ts , make sure it is located at pages/api/auth/login/route.ts in your project directory. Export your route handler function as the default export from your route handler file. Also, make sure your route handler is correctly handling POST requests. You can use the req.method property to check the HTTP method of the incoming request and respond accordingly. I would assume you are using NextJS 13.4+ Based on those suggestions, the code would be: Route Handler ( route.ts ): Login Page ( page.tsx ): In the route handler ( route.ts ), I have added a check to make sure the request method is POST using if (req.method !== 'POST') . In the login page ( page.tsx ), I fixed the URL in the fetch function to match the location of the route handler file ( /api/auth/login/route ). The all process: I think you should send a POST json request, handling it with javascript: And in the api:
