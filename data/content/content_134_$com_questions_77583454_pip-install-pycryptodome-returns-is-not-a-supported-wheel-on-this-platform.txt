I am trying to install pycryptodome-3.19.0 and pycryptodomex-3.19.0 on Windows 11 and Python 3.10 in venv. Whl files were downloaded from pypi manually: Trying to install any of them I have an error: But why? There are most suitable whls availavle on pypi Whls are for windows and for python 3.10. Why it can't be installed? You've downloaded a PyPy wheel, but you're trying to install it on CPython. Look for a wheel tagged with cp instead of pp . Run pip debug -v to see a list of supported compatibility tags for your Python installation / platform.
