I want to modify the program to connect the series of dots that make up one stroke of a letter with a straight line so that words can be drawn but i don't really have a idea of how to do it so i want some references. I tried to draw them using drawLine but it's not what i really wanted. This is my code: Drag (multiple shapes) Connected lines Disconnected lines Some notes Don't use Vector , use ArrayList , you probably won't notice it, but ArrayList will be faster The Graphics 2D API already has a Point class, don't re-invent the wheel The "state" information the panel uses to paint the contents should be relative to it (or provide via some kind of model) paintComponent should be protected , there's no reason for anyone else to be calling it In this case, we don't even create any of the dots that you did. All we did is grab the point from the event using MouseEvent.getPoint() , then add it to our Vector . I also changed your MouseMotionAdapter to just be a plain MouseAdapter . Doing so gives us the mouseMoved , which I just used to reset our Vector and start a new one. Have to run, so I can answer questions when I get back.
