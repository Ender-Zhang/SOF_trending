I have a frame where the components are arranged using a GridBagLayout. My understanding about layouts is that if I use them they will automatically manage my components based on the screen resolution. My frame looks like the image below on my machine but when I run it on a different machine the layout gets messed up. Could anyone guide me with the right approach to fix this issue with different resolutions? On a screen with different resolution. The basic answer is that you are not using layout managers effectively. You are: using only a single layout manager hardcoding spacing values between components hardcoding the painting of the image So when you move to a different resolution or frame size the layout manager doesn't adjust since you have so many hardcoded values. For example: A spacing of 500 on one resolution won't work on another. Again, hardcoding the location assumes a given resolution. Also you should NOT override paint() of the Frame to paint the image. Instead I would suggest you override paint of a Canvas and then add the Canvas as a component to your frame. Also, you should learn how to nest a Canvas with different layout managers. For example for your radio buttons I would create a Canvas with a GridLayout that displays the button is a single column. Maybe for the buttons you create a buttons canvas with a BoxLayout and use "glue" between the two button so one is displayed on the left edge and one on the right edge. Then when you add the components to the GridBagLayout you have in the first column: the question label the canvas of radio buttons the canvas of buttons In the second column you have the image I suggest you read the section from the Swing tutorial on Layout Managers to learn the basics of each layout manger and how you might be able to nest them to achieve a dynamic layout. Yes, the tutorial is from Swing, but layout managers work the same in both AWT and Swing.
