I'm trying to make a machine learning model that operates validation extraction to distinguish whether it's bright or dark. I used the dataset " intel image classification " from kaggle. First Problem I used 127.5 (which is half of 255) to train whether it's bright or dark. I know it can cause inaccuracy, but there are 14k images only for training so I couldn't label all those images. I would be grateful if you suggest me any other way to label images. if I don't put '.all()' method at the end, I get error which is ValueError: The truth value of an array with more than one element is ambiguous. Use a.any() or a.all() I can't understand why this error comes up even data is composed of numbers not boolean. Second Problem if i use'.all()' method, then this two errors comes out. TypeError: only size-1 arrays can be converted to Python scalars ValueError: setting an array element with a sequence. I really appreciate for your help in advance. Hope you have a great day. There are several issues with the approach you have taken in analyzing solving the problem itself. I went through your code and the Intel data. For your first question, the variable brightness_data is a 2D list and therefore would need any or all if you are doing a condition check. You can something like the following to achieve what you want: np.mean(brightness_data[i]) < 127.5 The second problem comes due to the fact all pics are not of same size. While most images are 150x150 size, there are some images which do not follow this shape, for example 5358.jpg which is 150x124 and this is causing the second error for you because the list shape goes once you append this image. To avoid this, you can probably skip those images from training to start with.
