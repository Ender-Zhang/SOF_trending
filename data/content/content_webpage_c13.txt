I am having trouble getting a child component to render when I click on it's parent component. When I click on a link to go to my "settings" page, my SettingsSummaryPage is rendered, but I'd also like SettingsPage component to be rendered as well—as a child. I think I have things set up correctly—my routes.js file looks like this: My SettingsSummary.vue component looks like this: And my SettingsPage.vue component looks like this: So what I am expecting to see when I click on a link to "settings" is a page that has my navigation along with "Settings page works!" off to the side. All of this works great if I click my /settings link -- then totally refresh the page.
How can I get my SettingsPage component to render without refreshing the page? After finding the correct goole search term(s) I stumbled across this SO thread. The route(s) & component(s) are configured correctly, what I was doing wrong was linking to the incorrect route. Using the above as an example, to get the "settings" page to render, instead of using app.settings.summary as the :to link, I needed to link to the child. In this case, app.settings . You'll also want to go back and remove the name from the parent route. Again, using the above as an example, you'll wan to remove: If you leave the name, you'll get an error in the console.
