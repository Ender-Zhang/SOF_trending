I have a double value between .0d (inclusive) and 60.0d (exclusive). How can I format the value with left zero padded? for instance, 0.1234567 -> 00.1234567 5.12345678 -> 05.12345678 31.123456789 -> 31.123456789 59.0000000001.... -> 59.0000000001.... Use the DecimalFormat class. Output You can do it easily with String.format() : I'm currently solving my problem with the following logic.
