In the new Javadoc api jdk.javadoc.doclet.* , I cannot find a way to change the Javadoc comment. I want to change only few things in the comment and parameter method through a custom doclet. I do not want to change the whole process of generating HTML files that must remain. I tried something like this, but it depends on the previous Javadoc API com.sun.source.doctree.* It seems that setRawCommentText() does not exist in the new javadoc API. Can you publish some tutorial how to do it in the new API if existing?
