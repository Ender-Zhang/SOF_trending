My application is using: spring-boot: 1.5.22.RELEASE spring-boot-starter-actuator: 1.5.22.RELEASE micrometer-spring-legacy: 1.3.5 micrometer-registry-prometheus: 1.3.5 application.properties: Dockerfile (modified a bit to hide some info): My prometheus endpoint works fine takes around 20 ms on my local machine. When I deploy it on K8s and use Docker it takes around 12-18 seconds. Canary deployment also fails because the flagger advancement request takes more than 8 seconds whereas our pipelines threshold is 500 ms. Things I tried but they didn't change the result: upgraded micrometer-spring-legacy and micrometer-registry-prometheus to 1.3.20 set management.metrics.web.server.auto-time-requests=false in application.property resolve any kind of dependency issue in pom.xml removed/commented out any usage of io.micrometer.core.instrument.MeterRegistry However, when I make a custom controller having a "/prometheus" endpoint, it passes the advancement request flagger checks and the canary deployment is successful. Only the PrometheusController change has worked but I don't understand the reason. Why is it working with a manually defined endpoint? How can I resolve this issue?
