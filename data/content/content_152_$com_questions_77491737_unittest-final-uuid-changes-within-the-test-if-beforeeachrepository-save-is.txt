I have an OrderRepositoryTest code below where I am trying to get the valid order by Uuid OrderRepositoryTest Order OrderRepository I would get error: Expected [correct_uuid] but was [wrong_uuid] . However, if I comment the orderRepository.save(order2); and orderRepository.deleteAll(); , both uuids matches and the test will pass. My expected result should be even if I run the .save() and .delete() method, since the UUID id2 is a final variable, it should always be the same. Note : I initially tries assigning the id2 as: private static final UUID id2 = UUID.randomUUID(); but this failed too. Note2 : I could do the following: This will pass the test but I feel that I should be able to use the initially assigned UUID instead thus I did not do it like this. The "problem" is that the id is auto generated, because of the annotation @GeneratedValue. When you call 'orderRepository.save(order2);' the id value you passed when building the order is ignored and a new UUID is automatically generated. You should not set the id for order, since it's auto generated by the persistence layer.
