I need to install the eb command on windows. I would like to try to deploy an application on AWS using the elasticbeanstalk service, and through this command you can configure and deploy an environment directly with a configuration file. To do this I followed the guide . I first installed python via the site (Python version 3.12.0), and then all the steps described in the guide link. Now if I run the eb command from cmd I always get this error. I've tried several things but can't come to a conclusion.
Does anyone know how to help me? I also tried installing previous versions of python, even though I didn't like it as a solution, but still I still have the problem. I encountered this as well.   As far as I understand its a depreciation issue. awsebcli will install with Python 3.12 but imp will not. If you type import imp into Python 3.11 you will get the following response At the time of writing this Electric Beanstalk is only supporting 3.8, 3.9 & 3.11 https://docs.aws.amazon.com/elasticbeanstalk/latest/platforms/platforms-supported.html#platforms-supported.python
