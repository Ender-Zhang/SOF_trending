This question already has answers here : Sort list by function with multiple arguments [duplicate] (1 answer) How to pass multiple arguments to the method 'key' of sorted()? (3 answers) Closed 2 days ago . I am trying to sort a list using a custom function. If the function has only one parameter, it is fine. I don't know how to do if the function has 2 parameters. For example, when the function has only one parameter. Now I am doing a function with 2 parameters like this, then I got an error, how to solve it? Thanks In your first example you are correctly passing through sort_by_well_range function itself as the key argument, in the second example you are calling sort_by_well_range_1 and passing through the return value of that function as the key argument. You need a function which takes one argument to pass as the key argument. One way to do this is to wrap it in a small anonymous lambda function: There is also a helper function in functools called partial which will create a new function for you with certain parameters set which you could use: This is more common if you need to re-use the same parameters to a function instead of declaring it over and over. The sorted function's key argument is a callable that takes one argument. It can't take two or more arguments. However, a function can take your start parameter and return a function which takes col as an argument. You may be looking for something like the following.
