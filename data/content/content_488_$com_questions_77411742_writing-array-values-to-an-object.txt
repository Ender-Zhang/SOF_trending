I have the code here I iterate through the array and write the direction of movement to the object. Is it possible to somehow simplify the expressions? for example use 1 reduce. It seems to me that it can be done without two filter and reduce, but I don’t quite understand how. I write this data into an object, with the number of times it turns in a certain direction you can simply iterate through forEach, but I wanted to practice reduce, although it’s not relevant here You could take the direction as ke for getting a total for every direction. Here, the reduce function iterates through the walk array, and for each direction encountered, it updates the object with the count of that direction. The acc (accumulator) starts as an empty object {}. If the direction is 'n', it increments the "north" count in the object, and if the direction is 's', it increments the "south" count. This way, you achieve the same result with a single reduce operation and avoid the need for separate filter and reduce operations. Inside the .reduce callback you check for the value of the current item and assign accordingly to the accumulator. In the second parameter of .reduce we pass the initial value of the accumulator to start at 0 each direction.
