For example i have list, class and methods: My method: How can I cause an exception when client is not found. I just need to display the message without stopping the program. Is this even possible? Overall, I think the purpose of your method is somewhat pointless. That's because getting a client's name is already served by a different class's method: Client#getFullName . You can definitely have a method which returns the Client though: Note the lack of any introduced variables, break; , or null values. You will either retrieve a Client (presuming the ID is valid), or you will get an exception if the loop couldn't find one. I made one final improvement for the sake of debugging: note the customerID that is passed to the exception now: Finally, you can rest easy knowing there aren't clients without names (unless Client itself allows such shenanigans): Given the nature of your lookup ( O(n) ), you may benefit further from using a Map<String, Client> to quickly find the clients (treated as out-of-scope for this answer), or from keeping the Client in a variable between multiple invocations: I just need to display the message without stopping the program. You could utilize the standard-error stream.
