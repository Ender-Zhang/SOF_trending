I'm pretty new to JavaFX. I am trying to make this timeline where each keyframe happens after the previous one has finished. So far, each of the steps happen one after the other like I want it to. However, the rotateBack keyframe starts rotating my object as soon as I play the animation. Any tips on how to make rotateBack only play right after moveToRight? Also, I would like for rotateBack to finish its rotation before moveToTop plays. Thanks. What I've tried so far is shown in the code above. Any tips very much appreciated. To play a keyframe only after one is finished you can create different Timeline and in the timeline.setOnFinished() function you can play the next one. For your example it would look like this : Here it will play all these KeyFrames (startFrame, moveToBottom, moveToRight) first and when all animations are finished it will play rotateBack KeyFrame and when this one is finished it will play moveToTop A Transition is a good fit for this problem An example is provided which is based on a SequentialTransition , rather than a Timeline .  You could use a Timeline instead, as noted in other comments or answers.  However, for the functionality you describe, using transitions seems to be a better fit. The example sequences various transactions of types TranslateTransition and RotateTransition to perform the required animation. If you wanted parts of the sequence to be performed in parallel, then you can use a ParallelTransition for those portions (parallel and sequential transitions can be combined if desired). Use translate properties for animation The translateX/Y/Z properties should be used when performing animation rather than the layoutX/Y properties.  While you can animate layout changes , that is an advanced topic and not recommended for somebody pretty new to JavaFX.  The example provided here is based on translate properties and not layout properties. Choose an appropriate Interpolator The default interpolater for key frames is LINEAR , and for transitions is EASE_BOTH . Choose an interpolator appropriate for your application by setting the interpolator on your key frames or transitions.  For this example, I felt that the default EASE_BOTH interpolation for transitions was the best fit, resulting in a smoother animation feel. Example Code
