Once again I am looking for Kattis problems to solve in python3 and I have come across another one that I have encountered a hidden test case. The problem is Credit Card Payment (problem ID: creditcard), available here .
I've understood the problem to be of a few parts, and I started with some pseudocode: It seems simple enough to me at first. I then got to work implementing it. I had multiple solutions on how to round half up, and each one gave a slightly different amount of test cases passed.
My current code with the most amount passed (2/5): To round the interest, I also tried round(interest * 100) / 100 but there was still 2/5 test cases passed. I tried using a function and calling it like interest = float(round_decimal(Decimal(str(interest)))) but that only passed 1/5, with the second test case being a runtime error.
At this point I expected it to go wrong honestly. There must be something wrong with my code, I can't get it right the first time and I knew that from the start. On the competitive programming book I found the problem from, it says in the description "real life issue; precision error issue if we do not convert double (with just 2 digits after decimal point) into long long" Can anybody help me work out what's wrong with my code and why test cases aren't working?
