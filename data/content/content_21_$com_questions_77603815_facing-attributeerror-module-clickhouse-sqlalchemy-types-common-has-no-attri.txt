did !pip install great expectation in the deepnote, but when i import great_expectations as gx it gives the error. Tried from a different device aswell but getting the same issue. Just wanted to setup a basic great expectation for a demo, if anyone can help it would be greatly appreciated. The entire error ----------------------------------------------------------- AttributeError                            Traceback (most recent call last)

Megan from Deepnote here. Per the docs on Great Expectations here, have you also run !great_expectations --yes --v3-api init to initialize GE?
