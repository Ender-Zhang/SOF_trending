I have an array like the following I want to split the items in the array with the following conditions if there is a variable (curly bracket) and there is content after the variable, that line should be split into 2 lines. If there is no content after the variable it can be kept as it is. For example following is the output i need What i tried so far is as follows It does not return the exact response i need. How can i form the array as shown in the question when provided with the original array Flat-map the array, splitting each entry on a lookbehind regex matching your variable format I've also used String.prototype.trim() to remove the spaces after variables . Note: Lookbehind doesn't work in IE or Opera Mini if that matters You can do it one line like this.
