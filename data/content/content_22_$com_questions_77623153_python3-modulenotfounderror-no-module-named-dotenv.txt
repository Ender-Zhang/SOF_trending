I'm getting ModuleNotFoundError: No module named 'dotenv' error. I did install python-dotenv as suggested in other posts but it still gives error. How to fix it? My code Error Make sure it's installed in the same virtual environment (venv) as your project Before running that command ensure your venv is live by running: For Mac/Linux For Windows Also try reopening the project after installing Hope this helps!
