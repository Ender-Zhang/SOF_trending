I am building one Project (To-Do-App) with login functionality,
In this Home component I have to check if token is not set in the localStorage, then navigate to login component, But after the navigate, Home component still renders and in this component I have an API call, so because of the token not found in localStorage, it throws an error "Unauthorized" Home Component: Inside NotesContainer Component I have API call. NotesContainer: In current scenario, when I go to home component it will check for token, and if token is not set then it will navigate to Login component, but still home component is rendering and because of that my API call generate and throw an error. So, I want that if token is not set in the localStorage then navigate to login before rendering the Home component so we can stop that API call. There are several options available to you to avoid the getNotes call in the NotesContainer component. Here are a few suggestions. Conditionally render the NotesContainer component only if there is a token value. Conditionally render the Home component's content or null if there is no token. Conditionally render the Home component's content or redirect if there is no token. Unconditionally render the Home component's content, including the NotesContainer component, and check for the token in NotesContainer . Rather than wait for your component to mount and run the effect hook (which is too late), use conditional rendering to render a <Navigate> component. This will avoid rendering your <NotesContainer> and thus any unauthenticated API calls. Make it simple and easy: It will be better to use Context API to make a global auth state
