I have a table like this: My querie would be this: So my where statements has two select so should I make another index on shop_id like this ? If you have two conditions in your WHERE clause that are linked with AND , each result row must satisfy both conditions. That means that query execution is already very efficient if there is at most one table row that satisfied the first condition, and you have an index for that condition. That is the case here: since id is the primary key, there is automatically a unique index on that column, so scanning that index will return at most one row. So there is no need to index the other condition; PostgreSQL will apply an additional filter that may eliminate the row found with the index scan if necessary.
