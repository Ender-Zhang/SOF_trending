Improve this question I have a machine plearning model that is running classification on the raspberry pi 4 I placed the two wires of multimeter on the pins 5V and GPio NO: 40 but it shows that more current is drawn when my raspberry pi is not rumming ML model. I connected USB power from my laptop to raspberry pi.
I want to know the reason behind this thing, is it because I am using wrong pins to measure current ? The readings I recieved are: 99.2 micro ampere[without ML model running] and 97.2 micro ampere [while model is running] I would also like to know is it possible to do data logging(current values WRT TIMESTAMP to create a plot) using Labview programming Why is this happening? I expected Raspberry pi to draw more current in the case of ML model running as the algorithm would require more current due to calculations happening.
