I am creating a gauge using svg. Is there a way to add an arrow at the end of the animated gauge to indicate the entered value? Since the gauge is displayed with the path's stroke-dasharray, it seems that a marker cannot be applied according to the svg specification. If this is not possible, please advise if there is an alternative. The main idea is this:
you calculate the end point of the gauge using getPointAtLength and you move the arrow at this point. Also you calculate the angle of the path at the end point so that you can rotate the arrow accordingly. In order to calculate the angle you will need 2 points: • point1 i.e the end point of the gauge • point2 i.e a slightly offseted point ( val + 0.1 ). This will work unless the value of the slider is 100. In this case I use the arrow as a marker. Observation: This solution is not perfect. If you move the slider very fast you may get an offseted arrow. In this example I just use a simple polygon as an arrow. The arrow is rotated from the center point.
