When I run model.predict(##) , I get the result nan . I also get this for calculating the loss function. This is what my code looks like: And this is what some of the training data looks like:
x_train: And then my y_train values are either 0, 50, or 100, and cannot be anything else. I would expect a prediction somewhere from 0 to 100, but instead I get NAN (not a number) Did your try with Adam optimizer? Instead of SGD? By keeping your code and the information on the input/output of your database here is a code that runs without NAN Also as mentionned by @mhenning, there are some good pratices you need to try.
