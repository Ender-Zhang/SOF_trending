I have a Java program that communicates with various devices to retrieve data via serial communication. I'm using the jSerialComm library for this purpose. However, when I retrieve data from a particular device using this Java program, the data appears to be corrupted. Surprisingly, when I use a C# program without any external libraries to retrieve data from the same device, the data is received correctly, without any corruption. The device configuration settings are as follows: In my Java program, I'm using the jSerialComm library, while in the C# program, I'm not utilizing any external libraries. My Java program can successfully detect and retrieve normal data from other devices using the same communication settings. The data corruption issue seems to be specific to this particular device. I have compared the logs from both programs and observed that the C# program consistently receives the expected data, whereas the Java program consistently receives corrupted data from this specific device. I have also attempted to modify the baud rate and parity settings in the Java program, but the issue persists. Java Program Connect Device: Java Data listening: Java Program Log File: C# Program Connect Device: C# Program Data listening: C# Program Log File: My goal is to understand why the Java program using the jSerialComm library encounters data corruption only with this specific device, while it can successfully retrieve normal data from other devices. How to modify my Java program to receive the data correctly from this particular device? Try like this:
