I am unable to use Flask-Login 's signals as they are described. I am under the assumption that every time a user logged in, whether from a cookie or not, the user_logged_in signal would be called. I can only trigger it on a fresh login however. I tried using user_loaded_from_cookie as suggested by this answer , however I am unable to get it to be called at all, despite testing on several different browsers with long intervals in between. I need this functionality to check against a user's subscription to redirect them if they try accessing content they could previously access. I have considered using @app.before_request , however for users logged in with active subscriptions, the routes get called so frequently that I feel using it would perform very poorly since I would be adding another query to all the requests.
