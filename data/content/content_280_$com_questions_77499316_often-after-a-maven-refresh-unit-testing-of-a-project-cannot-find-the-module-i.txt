My first module in my project list has ten unit tests and a module-info.java containing: that from a mvn clean install in a command line, compiles and succeed its tests. Depending of an amount of luck, when I refresh the whole maven Project, either the project and its tests are also compiling, and the whole application is buildable and testable also from IntelliJ 2023.2.5 , either the tests launched from the IDE immediately stops with the error: and a Build Project or a Rebuild Project attempting to rebuild all the application, will fail with the message: But, if I rebuild only that module by right clicking on its context menu, the build will succeed and the unit tests also. Because I cannot then build by IntelliJ the remaining of my application, I cannot it to test it anymore, and I have to switch to the command line to perform the building, with Maven . When I stumble into this problem, currently, my workaround is too try Repair IDE , restart it, sometimes have to delete the .idea folder (but this causes me loosing all my personal settings), and at a time, IntelliJ restarts understanding the whole project well again. But it's long. Very long. Each time this trouble happens, is often 1h30 I have to spend on it, and I would like to find a way to fix it quickly when it happens. The issue here seems to stem from IDEA using its' own Build System for some of the options it offers (for instance, options from the "Build" menu are based on the Native Build System), even if the Project in question is Maven-based. Native Build System tries to stick to Maven conventions, but there might be discrepancies, that may, in turn, lead to issues you are describing. For Maven-based Projects it's best to use options from the Maven Tool Window (and corresponding Run/Debug Configurations ). You can also enable " Delegate IDE build/run actions to Maven ". Might be a good idea to submit a YouTrack Issue with a reproducer Project attached, so this can be fully investigated and resolved.
