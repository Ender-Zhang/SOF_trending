I have a project using the jacob project to automate SAP gui automation (version 7.70). I'm able to access a GuiGridView as an ActiveXComponent.  The subtype shows it's a GridView when I call grid.getPropertyAsString("SubType") . The visible row count returned is correct when I call Dispatch.call(grid, "VisibleRowCount").toString() .  Double clicking a cell does not error when I call Dispatch.call(grid, "DoubleClickCurrentCell") .  However, I'm unable to get past an error occurring when I try to get a cell value via Dispatch.call(grid, "GetCellValue", Integer.valueOf(1), "Synchronization Object") .  I get an error Trying to wrap them in an array of objects like I've seen done in the PoojaGugu  library I get: And trying to pass them in as Variants, I get: Any suggestions about what I might be overlooking or where I'm going wrong with this? Ok, I figured it out.  The format of was correct, but I needed to use the column identifier (like ID or RL_FROM_T) rather than the column name (like "Synchronization Object" or "From Release").
