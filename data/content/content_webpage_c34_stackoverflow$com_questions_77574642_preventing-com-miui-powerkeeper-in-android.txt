I have a background application, and it is working like a charm but when I boot my device and call it with broadcast, it is not working because of com.miui.powerkeeper .
Here is the error log: So, how can I achieve this error and block com.miui.powerkeeper programmatically in Android? I tried giving battery optimization permission, but it did not work.
