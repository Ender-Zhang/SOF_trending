I have a Java desktop application which hangs at-times while running a scenario. I tried to take heap and thread dump for analysis.
Up until the application hangs I am able to take the heap and thread dumps but once the application hangs neither thread dump nor heap dump works. The profilers just behaves like nothing happened or hanged. I tried , Jprofiler, JvisualVm, and also Jstack command. None of these applications can take a dump. When I tried to connect to the application after it’s hanged, profilers cannot attach to it. What’s the reason behind it ? I assume that the profiler needs a thread in application to be able to attach to it and that is hanged? Is there any workaround for this .
