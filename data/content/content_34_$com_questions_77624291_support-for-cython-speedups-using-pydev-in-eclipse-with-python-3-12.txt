I'm using a fresh install of the latest Eclipse, PyDev and Python 3.12. I get a warning warning: Debugger speedups using cython not found when debugging some Python code. (I've run the suggested command for setup_pydevd_cython.py but the warning persists.) I traced the warning to the end of pydevd_frame_eval_main.py with the call to pydev_log.show_compile_cython_command_line() . I modified the file to print the ImportError and got the message: I noticed no _pydevd_frame_eval_ext folder exists in the pysrc path. Also, the _pydevd_frame_eval folder has no .pyd file for Python 3.12 (it stops at 3.10). How can I get cython speedups to work for my setup?
