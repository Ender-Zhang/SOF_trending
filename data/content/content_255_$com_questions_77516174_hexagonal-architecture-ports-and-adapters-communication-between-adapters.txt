I have read quite a few articles about ports and adapters. Considering communication, they all just speak about communicating between the different "layers" (domain, application, adapters) through ports. But what is the correct approach when I want to communicate between two different adapters? For example, I want to get a document from Elasticsearch and enrich this document by a few values which are stored in S3? I remember that a former colleague of mine said that it is ok when adapters communicate directly with each other (that is: call each other's public methods directly), without using ports. But is that really true ? Where can I find further information on that? And what would be the advantages/disadvantages of using ports for communication within a layer?
