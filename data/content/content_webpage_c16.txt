I'm trying to use vue-toastification as a Nuxt3 plugin. I'm getting undefined in the console. Nuxt documentation on this point does't really help. Any idea how to make it work? Check out "Registered Plugins" section in Nuxt documentation. It says: Only files at the top level of the directory (or index files within any subdirectories) will be auto-registered as plugins. You have your plugin as plugins/toast/toast.js , you need to rename it to index.js (not recommended) or simply move it to the parent folder. So you will get plugins/toast.js .
