You tried to access openai.ChatCompletion, but this is no longer supported in openai>=1.0.0 - see the README at https://github.com/openai/openai-python for the API. You can run openai migrate to automatically upgrade your codebase to use the 1.0.0 interface. Alternatively, you can pin your installation to the old version, e.g. <pip install openai==0.28> A detailed migration guide is available here: https://github.com/openai/openai-python/discussions/742 I tried both upgrading and downgrading through pip.

Solution Try this:
