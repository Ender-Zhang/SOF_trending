In my Java code, I have a simple record class just like so: When I run a JMH benchmark of code using this record, I notice something interesting in the CPU time flame graph that is generated at the end: This is just an excerpt from a much larger flame graph of the benchmarked code. The interesting thing here is that, for some reason, the default equals() method of the record seems to be doing some dynamic calls. Naively, I'd expect that the method would do something like this: Clearly, that is not the case. What does it actually do instead, and why? I looked for the source code, but I couldn't find anything. (I'm on OpenJDK Temurin-21.0.1+12 . The Pair you see in the flame graph is what is put into the record, and is itself also a record, whose equals() exhibits the same default behavior. Then inside the Pair , there are Integer s.)
