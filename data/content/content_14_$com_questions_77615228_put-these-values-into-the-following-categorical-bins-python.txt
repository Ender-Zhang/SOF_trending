The task is to put these values into the following categorical bins: unknown , 17 and under , 18-25 , 26-35 , 36-45 , 46-55 , and 56+ .
â€‹ The category labels should exactly match the above. Missing values should be replaced with the unknown category To make things easier and avoid ambiguity, let's say that any value with text, even if we could determine the age, will be binned with the unknown category. For example: sixty-nine should be coded as unknown , 45-55 should be coded as unknown , 59 on the day after Halloween should be coded as unknown , etc. Ensure that the category labels are unordered but reorder the categories so that 'unknown' is listed in the first position. This is not really needed but will help us grade your assignment. The categories should be listed as follows: Index(['unknown', '17 and under', '18-25', '26-35', '36-45', '46-55', '56+'], dtype='object') The error I keep getting is: Bin labels must be one fewer than the number of bin edges This Code is Already Provided This is my code Example plz provide minimal and reproducible input to solve your problem df Code Add -1 as a boundary to bins. and use to_numeric & cut df order of age_cat column
