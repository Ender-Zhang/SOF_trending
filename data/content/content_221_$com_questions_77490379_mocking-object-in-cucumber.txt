I'm trying to test my project using BDD and therefore im using Cucumber. The problem is, that when I want to test ProductController i can't properly mock my ProductService and i get NullPointerException - my service is null. Below is code for my steps. As i seen in cucumber guides i also created such a classes for cucumber configuration: and also: I'm trying to mock my service with mockito, yet every kind of configuration does not work and result in null pointer exception, i dont have any idea how to make it work. The class annotated with @CucumberContextConfiguration is used to configure the Spring application context using Springs Test Context Framework Manager. This includes setting up mocks through the MockitoTestExecutionListener . Declaring a mock bean can be done with an annoatation on the SpringGlue class. It is also possible to declare mocks by adding fields to the class and annotating those. And because of that the MockBean annotation on the ProductControllerSteps does not do anything. This class should look like: The autowired service will be a mock so you can use Mockito.when(...) as normal. Note: If you have multiple features they'll all use the same context configuration. If you need multiple configurations, multiple runners are needed with different glue configurations.
