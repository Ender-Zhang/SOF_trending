i am using Pyspark 3.4.1, java 8, hadoop 3.4.0, scala 2.12.17, python 3.11.4 and this is my code in vscode : I got this error : enter image description here enter image description here enter image description here Could anyone help me fix this ?
I'm trying using pyspark but got error every time, which version of spark,hadoop,java should i use ? I don't understand Spark very well, but I was able to fix this issue by upgrading Spark. The version numbers of PySpark and Spark itself matched exactly both times it was working for me, which makes me think they may have to be kept in lockstep -- perhaps someone else can confirm this. I had previously used PySpark 3.4.1 with Spark 3.4.1. I just upgraded PySpark to 3.5.0 and saw this error with Spark 3.4.1. Upgrading Spark itself to 3.5.0 resolved it.
