React native: Changing variable in redux state from test files in jest, after application build.
Since I cannot write the whole logic, components and props in the test file, I need to pass just one variable inside the react native app, and change its value from jest testing, so the approach is that I added a variable in redux state, and I want to change that variable while the app is running. The problem happens in the imports before even starting tests: login.test.js jest.config.json Note: transformIgnorePatterns has react-native-localize Full error message: I noticed the same error after updating React Native libraries adding support for the new Fabric architecture. Tests running with Jest are in a NodeJS (or JSDom) environment so all the native modules are unavailable. Some React Native libraries provide mocks for this situation. For all the other ones, you can provide your own mock like this: In jest.config.json This will run the content of jestSetup.js before each test file . Then create a new jestSetup.js file in src/__mocks__ Please note that this is not the only way to provide mocks with Jest but this one should work for most projects.
