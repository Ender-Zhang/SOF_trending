Is there any way to get notifications to redirect either to their "origin" or, ideally, to the installed PWA. Note: it's unclear to me if the web worker in this example is running on an isolated environment together with the installed PWA or still running in the main browser env -- which would seem relevant as to what it's client-list is. The problem is that your code doesn't differentiate between the PWA and the browser instance. You should modify the event listener to check if the PWA is installed and prioritize opening it:
