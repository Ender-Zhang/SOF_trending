The default TS type for window.Notification is Notification , but since the Web Notifications API has only 90% browser support, it should be Notification | undefined . I recently encountered a bug where I used window.Notification without checking if it's defined. Is there a way to override properties on window , such as making them optional? I tried this, but it didn't work: You cannot change the definition of a property, but you can: create a new type with changed property change window type to that newly defined type.
