Hi I'm new to Docker and testcontainers and I'm trying to create a DockerComposeContainer with a .yml file. I need to expose one of the services and tried using the .withExposedService( String Service, Integer Port) method. Though if I call .withExposedService the DockerComposeContainer tries to pull in Images alpine/socat:{$VERSION_NUMBER} . I do not want to ever pull in any images. How do I go about this? Here is my code I've tried using .withPull(false) , setting pull_policy: never in my docker-compose.yml .
My thought was .withPull(false) this issue should be resolved but maybe I don't understand the function properly.
