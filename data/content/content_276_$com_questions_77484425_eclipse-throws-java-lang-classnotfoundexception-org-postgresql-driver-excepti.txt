This question already has answers here : How do I resolve ClassNotFoundException? (29 answers) Closed 24 days ago . I am building a log in system for a university project using JDBC and Eclipse IDE.As a GUI there are two TextFields for the username and password and a login button. For this purpose I made a class called BDConnection which does the connection with the database and the code of which is bellow: Also, because I use JavaFX I made another class the LoginSignUpController which contains the method that the login button listens to: The application keeps throwing me the "java.lang.ClassNotFoundException: org.postgresql.Driver", although I have added the JDBC driver in the classpath. I also tried to add the external jar in the module path but still nothing. What might be the issue? Just for the others: The solution was to add the external JAR additionally to the runtime classpath, and not only to the projects classpath.
