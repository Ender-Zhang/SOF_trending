What's the simplest way with this jQuery change function to get bookmarked hash links to work, i.e. to be able to use example.com/#theme1 or example.com/#theme2 links? The jQuery #theme-selector changes the hash and shows/hides the relevant divs with the class, i.e. .theme1 or .theme2 , but when going to example.com/#theme1 from a bookmarked link, all divs are shown. In addition, if I manually refresh a URL with a hash, i.e. example.com/#theme1 , the hash remains #theme1 , but all divs are shown. Some other questions on SO deal with bookmarkable hashes, but they're many years old. And some libraries that appear useful are ten years old, too, like https://github.com/asual/jquery-address Unfortunately, running the snippet here won't show browser hash changes, nor will JSFiddle. You need to use $(location).attr('hash'); to get the current hash. I commented my code. NOTE : instead of using document.getElementById('theme-selector') , you can just use $(this) . EDIT : Change event handler should be defined before calling the .trigger('change') I have encountered this problem many times. This is the solution we use. It will handle the <select> changes and will trigger the changes if the theme is part of the url from direct links or bookmarked pages etc. Hopefully it is a little more succinct and efficient:
