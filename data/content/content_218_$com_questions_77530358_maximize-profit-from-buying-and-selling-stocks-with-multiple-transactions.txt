I am working on a problem where I need to maximize profit from buying and selling stocks with multiple transactions. The task is to find and return the maximum profit achievable given an integer array prices , where prices[i] is the price of a stock on the ith day. Examples: Example 1: Example 2: Example 3: Constraints: I have implemented a solution in Java, but it's not giving the correct output for all cases. Here's the current implementation: I would appreciate any insights or suggestions on how to improve the current implementation to correctly solve the problem. Thank you! You're looking for local minimums and maximums.  I'm not going to write the code, but here's an outline of one algorithm.
