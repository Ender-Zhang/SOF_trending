If the pagesize is 10 and pageNumber is 0, for the given condition, if I I get 50 documents from mongodb, then total_documents should be 50 and msList should have the details of 1st 10 documents(DTO's)(since the pageNumber is 0 i.e. pagination). I am able to achieve this functionality using the above code, but the problem here is we are making mongodb calls 2 times. Would it be possible to achieve the same functionality using only one mongodb call? Could someone please help on this regard. When pagination is performed, usually, use two queries: first query will count a total size, second query returns actual records using two parameters: pageNumber and pageSize . These two queries are independent of each other and cannot be joined. So, it's impossible using CreteriaQuery API and in pagination themselves. It is possible to achieve the pagination in one call with $facet . Just be reminded not to have too large page size since it would fail due to 16MB MongoDB document size limit . Mongo Playground
