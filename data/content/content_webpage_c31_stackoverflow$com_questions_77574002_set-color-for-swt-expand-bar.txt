I am using expand bar in an eclipse application UI. The default color of expand bar item is light grey and I need to change the background color of expand bar item using SWT java. I have tried setting the background color of expand bar, but that'll change the overall background of expand bar ( dark grey in the image ). And setting the foreground color of expand bar, will change the text color. There is no method to set the background& foreground color of expand bar item. The color of expand bar is dark grey, which requires no change & the expand bar item is light grey, which needs to be changed. The code for setting expand bar & it's item is as follows - I've tried adding paint listner to expand item, but that didn't work. Any other way to set the background color of expand bar item ?
