As I am overriding onBackPressed() method in multiple activities of my Android project but it is not getting called, and my block of code is like below: But this block is not getting visited on back press and it goes to previous activity. I have searched and found people work with onKeyUp and onKeyDown , which I don't want to use because in my other projects I am using onBackPressed() , where target sdk versions all are same, and there it works fine. What should I do to get this done?, Please help me to figure out this problem. on onBackPressed() is deprecated for higher android versions. Instead try using the onBackPressedDispatcher.
Add a call back when the activity/ fragment is created and don't forget to pass the lifercycle owner otherwise the callback won't be called, and remove it when the activity/ fragment is destroyed.
Kotlin example code: Though it's difficult to answer without looking at the high level app structure but I will still try. Fragments - If you are overriding onBackPressed() within the fragments that are hosted by your activity and not calling super.onBackPressed() or the way your fragments handle onBackPressed() can cause this issue. Super - Make sure you are calling super.onBackPressed() in all the overridden onBackPressed() methods to make sure the default behaviour remains intact.
