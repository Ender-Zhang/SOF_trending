I have a DataFrame containing Date as an index and S&P500 closing prices. Next I compute % change on Daily Basis I can compute Returns as follows: Resample shrinks daily data into smaller weekly data. Instead How do I compute running Weekly Return, i.e., I need to see partial weekly returns every week that gets reset at the beginning of the week or month etc? I tried the following that yields useful info, but not quite the same info I am looking for
