Can I somehow draw a 3d grid in my libgdx app, so I can zoom in and out of this grid in order to see what is going on with my application?
For example, I'm trying to create a simple sphere, that should be in the middle of the screen, but it is not, and it is squished or somethig. I want to know, where my camera is and what is the camera's view angle, all inside the scene. Here is the code, because stackoverflow asks for the code. Can I do that? You can use 'createLineGrid' on ModelBuilder to create a grid that (unless you rotate it) extends in the X-Z plane. For example: Where grid is a Model and gridInstance is a ModelInstance .
Then you just have to include a render call to your ModelBatch : Doing that on you code yields this render: You can customize how many grid lines and their spacing to fit your need. After a little bit of seraching, I found this amazing list of examples for libgdx, including grid with axis: And here is an example how to use it: https://github.com/libgdx/libgdx/blob/master/tests/gdx-tests/src/com/badlogic/gdx/tests/g3d/BaseG3dTest.java
