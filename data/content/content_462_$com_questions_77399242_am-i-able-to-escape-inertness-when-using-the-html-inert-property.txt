I'm building web component that contains <dialog> element. I'm opening the dialog with HTMLDialogElement.showModal() , which moves the dialog to the top layer. Some of the content of the dialog is top-layer incompatible, namely, Google Recaptcha, which renders beneath the dialog. A number of other individuals have noted the same issue with dialog elements and ReCaptcha , and one approach appears to be to use HTMLDialogElement.show() instead of showModal. From a usability standpoint, I think this is acceptable, but from an accessibility standpoint, I'd really like the benefits that HTMLDialogElement.showModal() provide. Namely, making all other HTML elements inert and thus noninteractive and hidden from the accessibility tree. And by using the inert attribute or property, I can make a certain subtree of an HTML document inert myself. As of today's date (2023-10-31), both MDN and the HTML Living Specification indicate that it's possible to "escape inertness", but this doesn't appear to be possible for HTML authors. For example, using Chrome/Edge, with the following HTML, I can't interact with the elements inside of the dialog if opened with .show() , when I'm attempting to deliberately "escape inertness" via setting the dialog's inert property to false. Is it possible for HTML authors to be able to escape inertness in this way? Not 100% sure this help you or answers the question BUT, if I swap my thought pattern to the document and set document.body.inert = false; in the show method I CAN click the modal - no ReCapcha here to test that concept however.
