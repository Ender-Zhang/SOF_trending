I'm working on creating a panoramic 3D swiper carousel similar to the following design: However, my current implementation does not achieve the same effect, and the carousel looks like this instead: I want to achieve that carousel in CSS Here's the CSS code that I've tried so far: And here's a link to my CodeSandbox: https://codesandbox.io/s/coverflow-swiper-5kywvv?file=/src/App.css I tried tweaking  CSS to achieve that effect. But I am unable to get the same like that in the UI. I want my carousel to be like this Could anyone help me on how to adjust my CSS to achieve the desired effect? I will correct your initial solution, to continue work on your direction. I would place tiles into a flex container instead of using position: absolute . Make .coverflow-container as a flex. Then, you don’t have to apply horisontal transition to each element. Instead, you can do the shift to the whole container when active tile changes. I would recommend instead of using scale, applying transformZ on each tile. Since you are using perspective on the tiles container, we could use its advantage here on tiles, to shift them back from the front. The closer a tile to the center, the  far it by Z axis. For more gentle effect, I would also do rotateY on each element  progressively - the far a tile from the center, the bigger rotation on Y axis. Also, the more a tile rotated, the more it «shrinks», so we need to move it close to the center. For that we use translateX . Keep in mind, that the order in transform matters. So we first move a tile on its place, and then rotate. Here are the main changes I made. The full solution is here The solution will look like that: Duplicate of: How to get this curve effect using css with reactjs?
