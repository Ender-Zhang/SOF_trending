I have this ticket document in Mongo Database Now my requirement is filtered by these fields in a http request with API http://localhost:8080/ - get all without filter http://localhost:8080?state=1 get all documents where state equal 1 http://localhost:8080?state1&type=1 get all documents where state equal 1 and type equal 1 http://localhost:8080?state1&type=1&priority=1 get all documents where state equal 1 and type equal 1 and priority equal 1. I am using JPA MongoRepository interface and writing a Custom Query But for example when call http://localhost:8080/ and http://localhost:8080?state=1 is always return me Ticket[]. Comparing with PL/SQL I need something like What is wrong in my @Query definition ? After one day on possible workaround's I found other implementation. For a better control on Mongo query and operations I switch from MongoRepository to MongoTemplate and create mt custom methods with Criteria for parameters filters and validations, and TextCriteria for text search.
