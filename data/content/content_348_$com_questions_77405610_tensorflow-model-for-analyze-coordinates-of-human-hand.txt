I have a .csv file where I have columns like: (4 columns) coords file | Movement | sex | age fsdh7-444rsfds-d32.csv| fist| male| 48 ... and so on... ( Where is only 5 types of movement. ) where coords file (fsdh7-444rsfds-d32.csv) like: 64 columns (63 without TIME) start of table end of talbe and so on... I need to predict what Movement is for some data in .csv file , where data are everything that above but without Movement column (coords file, sex, age). I have function to get params from .csv file (coordinates from coords file without column "TIME"; sex; age) and write data for training as: (WRIST.x (first row), WRIST.y (first row), ..., PINKY_TIP.z (end row), sex, age) How to preprocess data - do I need to use coordinates + metadata or only coordinates? What model and layers do I have to use? I have some anomaly about ages (23 olds people have much more data than others): count data for ages Do I need to do something about it?
