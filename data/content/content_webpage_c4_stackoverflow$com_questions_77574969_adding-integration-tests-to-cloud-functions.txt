I am trying to follow this documentation to add integration tests to a cloud function: https://cloud.google.com/functions/docs/samples/functions-storage-integration-test The first step (setup) basically starts a process using java.lang.Process: This throws the error java.io.IOException: Cannot run program "mvn" (in directory "C:"): CreateProcess error=2, The system cannot find the file specified The same happens if I instead of C:\  I follow the example and use The funny thing is that if I just open a console and type When I pass the full path of the mvn command I end up with The path looks like "C:\Users\carlos.palma\apache-maven-3.8.8\bin\mvn" I can execute the cloud function locally. Is there something I'm missing related to the setup of this "Functions Framework Maven plugin" ?
