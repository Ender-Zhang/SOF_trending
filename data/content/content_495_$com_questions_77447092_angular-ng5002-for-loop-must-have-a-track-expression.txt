Angular 17 introduced a new control flow syntax moving from to When directly translating my loops, I get the following error: Background As part of the new control flow structure introduced in angular v17 the track expression needs to be defined. Track is used to keep track of items in an array and their association to the DOM. From the Angular documentation: The value of the track expression determines a key used to associate array items with the views in the DOM. Having clear indication of the item identity allows Angular to execute a minimal set of DOM operations as items are added, removed or moved in a collection. Loops over immutable data without trackBy as one of the most common causes for performance issues across Angular applications. Because of the potential for poor performance, the track expression is required for the @for loops. When in doubt, using track $index is a good default. From : https://angular.dev/guide/templates/control-flow#track-for-calculating-difference-of-two-collections Solutions Use a property of the element If the elements in your array have any kind of property attached to them that allows identifying them you can use it for the tracking. Any kind of ID works great. Use track $index This uses the index of the current row to associate the row with the element in the DOM. This can be used as default, if no better property is available and the array itself is immutable. $index will be recalculated if an item is added to the array, so it could lead to some unexpected behaviour or performance issues, and should not be used if a unique identifier is available.
