I have a ServerMain and a ClientMain that give a Socket to a Client and a Server Thread. I then try to make ObjectStreams using the same method but I get an error. error for ServerMain: abstractClass Client Server It wants me to write more. So yes, this is a stripped down version of the code so you don't have to read all the irrelevant stuff. Your main thread holding the Socket doesn't wait for the client / server to exit. It just starts the connection, starts the client / server and then immediately follows up by ending the try(){} block, closing the stream. You should .join() the thread you created, to make the main thread wait for the client / server thread to finish before proceeding, tho at that point I question why you would even have a new thread to begin with.
