I've been taken a bunch of JavaScript riddles lately and got really stuck on this one for like a day and a half (for context, all the others took 1 hour max). Since I want to come up with the final solution myself, I will post a somewhat similar piece of code just so I can grab the general idea and implement it as per the context of the riddle. Assume this is the piece of code: I'm aware this shouldn't be a case where maybe it will be used in everyday life, as it is a riddle and just meant to challenge our brain, but it challenged me to the point I give up haha. I tried looping over the entries of the Vehicle.prototype, and setting each one that is a function and is not the constructor to the same function bound to the class, or to the class.prototype or anything similar and it doesn't work. How can I go about solving it, or at least make it so I can edit a function call for every time a new instance of that class is created? Edit:
I tried using the bind method, even tried something like this I tried many alternatives and they didn't work since I have to have it bound to each instance of the class created. So if a new instance was created, and the same was done there, each one would return data according to the instance it was extracted from. To keep info === v.info as true . You need to use bind() . Update: Another elegant solution by gog . I added it here since this question is closed. The bind() method should be used in the constructor of the class, not on the prototype . If you want to bind a method to the class itself, not the instance, you can do it like this: In this case, Vehicle.info = Vehicle.info.bind(Vehicle); binds the info method to the Vehicle class itself. The issue you are facing is because when you destructure info from v instance, you are basically borrowing its method so this is no longer bound properly and you need to re-bind it.
