From Cannot use DRAGGABLE, RESIZEABLE & SELECTABLE at the same time it can be seen, that resizeability and draggability can be combined for a DIV in a jQuery environment. However, I have the question of how to create a resizeable and draggable DIV with Vanilla JS. It's easy, if the div has a structure e.g. with a header, then only the header can be user as handle for dragging and the resize handle in the lower right corner is free to user for resizing. For the user it's easy to understand, that he has to click on the header, if he wants to drag the whole box. If the div has only one content, the whole box has to be used as handle for dragging with the side effect, that a click on the resize handle is interpreted as drag event and no resizing is possible. Small test program for these 2 cases: https://jsfiddle.net/RanneR/skLvtehc/7/ Any ideas appreciated. I have created a movable class for my own project. although you have to modify it according to your needs, but should help get you started. Based on the example provided by @silver I updated and cleaned my test program. It now works fine. Thanks again. https://jsfiddle.net/RanneR/skLvtehc/12/ }
