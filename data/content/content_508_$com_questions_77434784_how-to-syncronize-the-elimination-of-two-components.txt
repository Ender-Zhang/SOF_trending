Lets say I have two componentes that display a common component when I make a delete request to the api inside one of the componentes the other component does not get deleted until I refresh the browser how can I fix that such that the common component gets eliminated at the same time here are the components: and Behavior pressing delete inside the card: You can use redux or context. Or make state in the main component including these two components which saves the task array. And use the state as props in these components. When you press the remove button, then please run the remove function in the main component. Then you'll get the result what you want.
