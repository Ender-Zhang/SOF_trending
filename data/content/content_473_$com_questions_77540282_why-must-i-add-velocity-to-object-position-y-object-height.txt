There nothing wrong with my code really. I was watching a tutorial to help me learn to make games in canvas. I’ve understood every single bit of it, but the one thing I don’t understand is why must I add velocity to my equation? I understand its the speed and direction of an object, but why must I add it? I’ve been trying to understand it for 8 hours now. And I don’t think I can continue with learning until I understand why. I’ve interrogated two separate AI bots, but what they were saying were making no sense to me whatsoever even when I asked them to simplify it. Here is my code of course: The specific part of the code I don’t understand is:
this.position.y + this.height + this.velocity.y <= canvas.height I understand that this.position.y + this.height is the position of the bottom of the player, but if I already have the bottom position of th eplayer, why do I have to add velocity? I’m only 15 and I just started taking geometry, lol. You're right to be confused, because the code is a mess. It will animate at different speeds depending on how quickly the browser can provide animation frames. Gravity causes the velocity to increase as time increases. Therefore, use the physics formula distance = initial speed + 0.5 * gravity * time^2 to get the distance that the box would have dropped at a particular time. Then use Math.min() to ensure that when the box reaches the bottom of the canvas, it cannot travel any further (because it has reached the ground).
