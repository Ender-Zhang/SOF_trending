Improve this question I am working on a password program for fun and recently implemented a scroll feature using the arrow keys. The way it works is just printing over the text that was already there. Since I have been programming it in VSCode, I just used the implemented terminal to see if it all worked (it did). The problem is that I need to actually reach the code I'm writing over. For the time being, I just used commands like print("\033\r[F\033\r[F\x1B[K") which worked, until it started doing this [F←[K in the proper .PY file. My question is; how can I go up a line and delete the full line without [F←[K popping up? (If all else fails, let me know if there is a better UI library I can use.) I believe you are using tkinter as UI in python. To get a better looking UI you can use CustomTkinter CustomTkinter git hub page
