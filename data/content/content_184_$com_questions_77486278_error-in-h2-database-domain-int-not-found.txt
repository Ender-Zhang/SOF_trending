org.h2.jdbc.JdbcSQLSyntaxErrorException: Domain "int" not found; I believe the issue is with the data type specification. How should I correctly define these columns in H2(version: 2.1.214) for intregation test? I'm also using MariaDB, so any suggestions on compatibility between the two databases would be helpful. Thanks in advance!
