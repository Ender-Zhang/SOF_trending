I want to combine two subjects in similar way as zip does, but with the following important difference. I want an observables that combines two subjects in this way. When both have emitted values, emit the latest of their values. Then, both need to emit at least once again, then emit their latest emitted values. Etc. Both subjects: 1 ---------- 2 ----- 3 -- 4 ------------------- 5 —— ------- a ------------------- b --- c — d —-———— Goal observable: ------- 1a ----------------- 4b ---————-5d —- Simple example: subject1 emits 5 times and after that subject2 emits once. The first emitted value of zip is a pair of both first emits of the subjects. I want (subj1-emit5, subj2-emit1). I think you could achieve what you want easily by just using combineLatest() with take(1) . Then to repeat the process add repeat() operator that will resubscribe after each sequence: Live demo: https://stackblitz.com/edit/rxjs-4vg6lu?devtoolsheight=60&file=index.ts I would proceed building an almostZip function with something like this (comments within the code to explain the logic) Here a stackblitz that represents how this work How about withLatestFrom ? stackblitz
