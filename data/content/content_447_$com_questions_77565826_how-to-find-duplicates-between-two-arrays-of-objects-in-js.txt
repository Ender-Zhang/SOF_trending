Here are two arrays of the objects I have in js: If duplicates are found, I want to set CheckedOut: true, CheckedIn: true . If it's NOT a duplicate, I want to set either CheckedOut: false, CheckedIn: true OR CheckedOut: true, CheckedIn: false depending on their attribute's values. This is the estimated result from the example: This is what I have done: Use an object like userName: {Name:..., CheckedIn:... CheckedOut:...} to accumulate values: After that, Object.values(diff) will return the data you're looking for. You could take an object for collecting and initialize each value with default properties. You can use a combination of map , find , and conditional statements to iterate through both arrays and update the properties accordingly. concat method is used to combine the items that are not duplicates from arrB. First, use Set() to get an array of unique names. Then, use map to build an object for each of the names, where you extract the properties you need from each of the source arrays: Here is a code snippet you can use to achieve the result you are looking for:
