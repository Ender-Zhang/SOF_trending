I'm going through the Python tutorial, and I got to the section on modules. I created a fibo.py file in Users/Me/code/Python   (s Now I'm back in the interpreter and I can't seem to import the module, because I don't understand how to import a relative (or absolute) path. I'm also thoroughly confused by how and if to modify PYTHONPATH and/or sys.path. All the other 'import module' questions on here seem to be  The only way to have paths for imports is when these are submodules or subpackages of some packge. This is explained in the tutorial . PYTHONPATH defines in which directories, other than the current working directory, the interpreter looks for an import. So, suppose you have your module at /Users/Code/Me/Python/fibo.py . If you set PYTHONPATH to /Users/Code/Me/Python/ , you will be able to import your module like this: If you're just testing, you can do Before importing any user defined module,specify the path to the directory containg that module
sys.path.append("path to your directory")
