I am trying to pass all the series in the chart from JS to CS using dotNetHelper.
But get error in this line "window.dotNetHelper.invokeMethodAsync('Items', allSeries)". I tried different methods as suggested in other stack overflow answers but not able to get it to work. Would appreciate your input. Error: jsinterop.js: ATComponent.cs: When you call dotNetHelper.invokeMethodAsync it implicitly calls JSON.stringify() and when the object you're passing has a circular reference it cannot be parsed so you get the TypeError: Converting circular structure to JSON error. e.g. Here the object is referencing itself with the .self keyword so trying to parse this object using JSON.stringify will lead to a circular reference error. That means we need to ensure that the object we're passing via dotNetHelper.invokeMethodAsync does not have any circular references and is parseable with JSON.stringify . To do this you can create a new object using the data you need from this.series.chart.series and pass the new object instead. While ensuring the properties also do not have circular references BlazorFiddle snippet setup with a demo, check browser console logs to see the different behaviours.
