Related to this question , given the following schema called customer.xsd : The following XML document called input.xml : And the following unmarshalling code: The Java code is able to deserialize the XML input document into an instance of Customer even when this XML document produces 2 validation errors (indicated by an external editor): and This means that JAXB did not validate the given XML input during unmarshalling, however: Given that unmarshaller.setSchema(null); was set to DISABLE schema validation, is there a way to demonstrate that the content of the customer.xsd file WAS NOT accessed by the JVM when unmarshalling occurred? In other words, is there a way to not blindly trust that the JVM won't load XSD references, even when schema validation is explicitly set to null ? Update 1: The purpose is to find out how likely are XSD schema references inside an XML document likely to become a security attack vector, as described by: https://owasp.org/www-community/vulnerabilities/XML_External_Entity_(XXE)_Processing https://cheatsheetseries.owasp.org/cheatsheets/XML_External_Entity_Prevention_Cheat_Sheet.html Thanks. I don't truly understand the need to check this but here's a simple use-case that should give the proof that the XSD file won't be loaded by the JVM when unmarshalling XML : Create the Java Classes from XSD by any plugin you want, or like here, create it manually. Package it in jar file without the XSD in it (only Java classes) Write the unmarshalling code from XML in another Java program, that depends on the first JAR and run it with no XSD whatsoever in your classpath ==> Your code will still work without knowing the XSD Schema You can also look at the Java Code itself : com.sun.xml.bind.v2.runtime.unmarshaller.UnmarshallerImpl which implements the Unmarshaller interface has default schema property to null (so setting it to null is a no-op in your above code) Your code doesn't reference XSD itself from which you created the Java XML-annotated-POJO : the JVM cannot guess that you write your code based on external schema. You could also run your program in debug mode and see that the XSD won't be loaded (again there's no reference in your Java Code : you could even have deleted it, it wouldn't have made a difference). Still, I Hope that I've answered to your question.
