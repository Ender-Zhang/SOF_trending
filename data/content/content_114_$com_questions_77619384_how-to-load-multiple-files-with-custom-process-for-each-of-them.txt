I have several CSVfiles with the same structure: data_product_1.csv data_product_2.csv data_product_3.csv etc. It is clear to me that to obtain a dataframe with all the data concatted together with polars, I can do something like: What I would like to do is to add an extra column to the final dataframe containing the name of the product, e.g. data value product_code 2000-01-01 1 product_1 2000-01-02 2 product_1 2000-01-01 3 product_2 2000-01-02 4 product_2 2000-01-01 5 product_3 I'm aware I can load the files one by one, add the extra column and concat them together afterwards but I was wondering if I'm missing some other way to take advantage of polars performances here. It seems you're wanting the filename added as a column, e.g. This has been requested a few times but is yet to be added to Polars: https://github.com/pola-rs/polars/issues/9096 You can replace read_csv with scan_csv which delays reading the file and returns a LazyFrame instead. The frames can be combined with concat which (by default) "computes" LazyFrames in parallel.
