I've come across the problem that intellij won't start the java application as it give me an error of abnormal build process termination. Keep in mind that the java application is using JDK 17. Did anyone came across this problem before? Steps to reproduce Starting the intellij and picking the java project. Starting the application Expected behaviour Application starts after compilation Actual behaviour Short error: Compiler intrinsic is defined for method [jdk.internal.misc.Unsafe.storeStoreFence()V], but the method is not annotated with @IntrinsicCandidate. Method will not be inlined.
Error occurred during initialization of VM Logs Turns out, updating the jdk version worked to solve the problem.
