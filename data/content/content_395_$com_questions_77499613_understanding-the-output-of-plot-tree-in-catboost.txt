I am trying to visualise the trees created by catboost model. But I am unable to understand the output being rendered. For eg: The initial node has the following value The following node has the below value What does this even mean? Merchant_Channel and Merchant_Id are categorical variables and the same has been provided while creating the pool. I would like to understand what values of Merchant_Channel and Merchant_Id is this particular tree utilizing to make the decision? What do value, counter_type, prior_numerator and border mean?
