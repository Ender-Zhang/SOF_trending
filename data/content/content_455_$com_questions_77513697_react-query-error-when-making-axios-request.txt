I am having trouble with this error message every time I try to send an axios request to fetch data.
' Starting with v5, only the "Object" form is allowed when calling query related functions. Please use the error stack to find the culprit call. ' I am still learning react so I'm currently unable to find the culprit through the dev tools. This is the topmost component where I called the react query provider App.js This is the component - React Query And this is the "ReactHome" component, where I submit the request. ReactHome.js I am trying to use react query to make an axios request to an API. I keep getting errors whenever I do so See the API reference for useQuery() in @tanstack/react-query v5+. The hook accepts an object with options as opposed to separate parameters. See also Migrating to TanStack Query v5 useQuery and friends used to have many overloads in TypeScript - different ways how the function can be invoked. Not only this was tough to maintain, type wise, it also required a runtime check to see which type the first and the second parameter, to correctly create options. now we only support the object format.
