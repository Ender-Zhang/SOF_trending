I have two Tables in my Application - Resident and Vehicle , which look like this: This has caused 3 tables created in my Postgres database: So this extra table resident_vehicles has been created automatically, there is no class for that table in my codebase. I have a complex query which requires me to call this table using native query. A simplified query for example would be: Please note that this query is a simplified version of what I want to do. My SQL queries are more complex, and most importantly dynamically generated at runtime. Using jpa repository methods are very difficult with the dynamic behaviour I have. I am using Java's Native query for my purpose, like this: However, this is causing the error: How do I solve this error? The issue is with this line You are trying to run a native query and since you don't have any mapping for the intermediate table this is the only way. But when we want to run a native query we should use the createNativeQuery method inside the EntityManager . The createQuery method is used for HQL queries for which mapping is required for all the specified tables and that's why you got this issue Links you can refer for detailed explanations JPA's EntityManager createQuery() vs createNamedQuery() vs createNativeQuery() Why do we need to create native query? use of entityManager.createNativeQuery(query,foo.class)
