I am passing an axios instance as extra argument to update user thunk action, but I am not able to access extra argument. I am only able to access all other fields like getState , dispatch , etc.
where axios instance is response from custom axios hook which i have used for adding token to headers before making request. profile.jsx userSlice.jsx The extra available in the thunkAPI is the "extra argument" specified to the thunk middleware on setup. See getDefaultMiddleware for more details and information. An alternative would be to just import axiosInstance directly in the user slice. If you must pass the axiosInstance from the calling React component then pass it in the action payload.
