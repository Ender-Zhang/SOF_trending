This question already has answers here : jOOQ with java 15: both interface org.jooq.Record in org.jooq and class java.lang.Record in java.lang match (2 answers) Closed 24 days ago . I've updated the Java runtime that will be used to build my application (from 11 to 17), and the source and target configurations continue to be 11. After trying to build using the Java 17, I got the following error message: reference to Record is ambiguous... both interface org.jooq.Record in
org.jooq and class java.lang.Record in java.lang match Does anyone know what's the problem and how to solve it? The problem is that jOOQ has a class name with the same name that the JDK does, so when you use the * (asterisk) to import the classes from jOOQ, the compiler doesn't know which class you are trying to use, for such cases you will need to import the org.jooq.Record explicitly.
