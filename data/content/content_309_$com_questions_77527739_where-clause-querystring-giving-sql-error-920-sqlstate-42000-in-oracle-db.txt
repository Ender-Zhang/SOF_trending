I have below code trying to fetch some data from Oracle DB tableName based on post request sent. I form query queryString using all post request inputs by appending over a loop, then send this queryString as whereClause parameter to Query in repository class. I am seeing error as below Hibernate: SELECT PALT_I, SIZE_C, AREA_C, DEPT_I, CLASS_I, ITEM_I, AISLE_I, BIN_I, LVL_I, PALT_UNIT_Q, AVAIL_PALT_UNIT_Q, PALT_PEND_POST_Q,PALT_PEND_PULL_Q, PALT_PEND_PTWY_Q, PULL_PALT_UNIT_Q, VCP_Q, SSP_Q, PALT_Q, CTN_PER_PALT_Q, EXPIRE_D, LOT_I, HOLD_STAT_C, STAT_C, MODF_USER_ID, MODF_PGM_N, MODF_TS FROM RSV_PALT WHERE (?)

Thank you. You define the query using: The bind variable :whereClause is a placeholder for a single scalar value which is passed directly to the database and is not used to build the query as part of a template string. Therefore, when the database evaluates the string it is the equivalent of evaluating: and WHERE ('some text') is an invalid SQL expression as it is missing a relational operator because the database is expecting WHERE ('some text' = 'some other text') . To fix it you need to generate the dynamic query text as part of the string and use bind variables to pass only values into the query and not trying to add the dynamic part of the query using bind variables. Something like: and then always pass departmentId , classId and itemId into the query but pass NULL values when you do not want to filter on them. I found out a way to do it. }
