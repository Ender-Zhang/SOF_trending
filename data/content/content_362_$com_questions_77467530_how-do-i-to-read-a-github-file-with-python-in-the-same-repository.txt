I keep getting a FileNotFoundError when I try to open a file in the same repository with my code. I want to use 'classifier_model.pkl' in 'SpecLines_App' ^This is what I've tried, and I'm not sure why it doesn't work. How could I open this? streamlit: classify-atomic-spec-lines.streamlit.app github: github.com/mblk3/MLM_Atomic_Spec_Lines You are attempting to open a relative pathname, so CWD will matter. You can learn what it is using: Consider doing a cd to a new directory before running this program. Opening an absolute pathname may be preferrable. This should obtain the location of your git repository: It looks like the classifier_model.pkl file does not exist in the current git branch from where your streamlit app SpecLines_App is being run.
Hence, you are getting the FileNotFoundError . To solve this, there are at least two solutions. Choose which one works better for your needs: Include the classifier_model.pkl file in your current git branch.
Then model = pd.read_pickle('classifier_model.pkl') should work. Download the classifier_model.pkl file at runtime if it does not exist (example code bellow):
