The community is reviewing whether to reopen this question as of 4 days ago . Improve this question I have downloaded with npm the new version of Angular and I haven't seen the app.module.ts file. Has it been eliminated from the project structure? Visual Studio Code files . I have tried creating a new one. It seems odd. From Angular v17 onwards, Standalone is now the new default for the CLI. So when you create a new project, you won't have any modules in it if you don't specify anything. However, it is still possible to create a module-based app by using the --no-standalone flag : ng new --no-standalone Standalone components are a feature introduced in v14. With the change in v17, the Angular team strongly recommends to use them as they are easier to use, understand and are require less boilerplate. For tutorials using standalone components, I advise you to get a look at the new documentation site .
