I have a Pan gesture handler inside a Pinch gesture handler to create the effects of multi-directional scrolling zoomable view that is all working well. But I am having issues where when users zoom in, the view is not zoomed in under their fingers rather when users zoom, the view would zoom some place else and not keep the same position. Here is my code: Here is a reproducible demo: Expo Demo This is the view: and here are my handlers: ATTEMPTS: Tried adjusting the handlers to consider the focal points but the zooming is still way off from the point of the fingers Actually I think that the idea of using focalPoints is great. But I would do that differently. Maybe you can create two Shared Values: Then in the pinch: And in the animated style you can try: Basically before scaling I'm just centering the scale transformation with the focal point position. Hopefully this works :)
