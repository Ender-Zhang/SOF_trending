the website shows 10 articles and then the user has to click a button "load more" and then, five new articles will loaded. But with Scrapy and Splash it doesn't work. So I downloaded the page with curl and this is the button: The splash code is: With the code the button should be clicked for 120 times, but it is not clicked once. I have a similar case with another page and I use the same Splash code for the following button and it works: Why is the button of the first html-code not clicked? What can be a solution? I prefer not to use selenium.
