I have an issue running a container which should execute a .jar file on a raspberry pi. The .jar contains a simple "Hello world" example code. I use Java 17, the raspberry pi runs on arm64v8. My dockerfile: I tried cmd instead of ENTRYPOINT too but there was no change in the behavior. My build command: docker build --platform linux/arm/v8 helloworldtest Then I tag/push the container and everything seems to be okay. But if I try to run the docker on my raspberry pi there is no output and it seems like the docker couldn't be started properly ( Exit Code 159 ) - there is no other error message. Do I miss something here? What could be the issue?
