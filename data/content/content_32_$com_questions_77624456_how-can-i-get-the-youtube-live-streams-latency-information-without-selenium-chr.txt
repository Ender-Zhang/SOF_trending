I'm trying to fetch the livestreaming latency in twitch and youtube. I resolved it for twitch with m3u8 file, however I can't resolve about it in youtube. The best scenario is parse the "Live latency" in "stats for nerds" in youtube livestreaming video player, and it is okay to get the latency information in ['Normal', 'Low', 'Ultra low']. But I can't find the youtube data api which returns the latency information, and also can't find with bs4. I tried to get the exact m3u8 url of youtube livestreaming and get uptime to check the delay, but it failed. I finally parsed the latency information successfully with selenium chromedriver, but my boss want another method because of the resource.
