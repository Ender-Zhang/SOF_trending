I am using swagger editor and have imported an openapi spec as a yaml but it shows errors due to all external refs Which points to the definition in another file Here is one of many identical errors: I am able to use validator badge tool to validate ( https://github.com/swagger-api/validator-badge ) so I know it's valid. So it seems that swagger editor is not considering the externally defined params. How can I get the externally defined params into swagger editor via yaml? I don't want to boot up the server and pass the url just to modify the openapi spec, would just want to import and edit directly.
