I'm trying to convert two dates into this pattern: yyyy-MM-dd HH:mm:ss.SSS . I need to retrieve two dates: Last year, same month, day 1, 00:00:00.000 Last day of previous month, 23:59:59.999 So, as of today, I need these two values: 2022-11-01 00:00:00.000 2023-10-31 23:59:59.999 The problem is: I get 2022-11-01 12:00:00.000 . This is the code that generates last year's date. If I try adding one hour, the output will be: 2022-11-01 13:00:00.000 . Also, I can't retrieve the last day of the previous month. As I have read here , all I keep getting is the first day of the next month. Here's the code. There is something I'm missing.
Any help is highly appreciated! You say any help is highly appreciated , so here's an example that uses java.time , which uses today as base and calculates the two desired results as follows: First of current month in the last year subtract a year from today ( 2023-11-17 ⇒ 2022-11-17 ) take the first of that month ( 2022-11-17 ⇒ 2022-11-01 ) involve the start of the day ( 2022-11-01 ⇒ 2022-11-01 00:00:00.000 ) Last day of last month at the end of the day subtract a month from today ( 2023-11-17 ⇒ 2023-10-17 ) go to the last day of that month ( 2023-10-17 ⇒ 2023-10-31 ) append the maximum time of day ( 2023-10-31 ⇒ 2023-10-31 23:59:59.999 ) Output (execution date 2023-11-17): "... I need to retrieve two dates: Last year, same month, day 1, 00:00:00.000 Last day of previous month, 23:59:59.999 ..." Here is an example. "... Also, I can't retrieve the last day of the previous month. As I have read here, all I keep getting is the first day of the next month. ..." Use the getActualMaximum method. "... I'm trying to convert two dates into this pattern: yyyy-MM-dd HH:mm:ss.SSS . ..." Optionally, you can use basic format specifiers here. There is a full list in the Formatter JavaDoc . Output
