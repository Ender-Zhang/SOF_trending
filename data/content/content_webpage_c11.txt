If I try to write the code below, I get the following error Exception in thread "main" java.lang.UnsatisfiedLinkError: Error looking up function 'SetWindowsHookEx': the specified procedure is not found. I'm using machine translation, so this English text could be wrong.
Also, since this is my first time asking this question, it would be great if you could tell me where I could improve. I wrote this code thinking that the message would appear in the console when clicked.
But I got an error that I don't understand. It is not much different from registering and creating any other handler. First you need to create the handler in an appropriate class implementing a NativeMouseListener (the libraries are in org.jnativehook.*): (you can add nativeMousePressed and nativeMouseReleased as well like this at this point) Secondly you need to register the handler: I have only showed the part of the code which helps you going forward from this point. If you have questions - just ask please.
