I'm a cypress beginner. I have a website and when I click on ' Login ' button ---> it opens a Microsoft login window. I want to access to MS login window to input my account BUT I don't know how to do it. Can anyone help me? I also try to perform like code And it isn't work. But I see command log, I have a URL and I want to take this url to visit but I don't know how to do it. do we have the way to get this url?

Option 1: Option 2: Note: Use these as reference. link1 link2 . Above mentioned things may not fully solve your problems but they definitely can give you a concept/path to achieve what you want.
