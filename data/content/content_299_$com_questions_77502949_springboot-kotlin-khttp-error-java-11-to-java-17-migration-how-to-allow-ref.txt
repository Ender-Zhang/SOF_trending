I am trying to migrate from Java 11 to Java 17. My app is written in Springboot and Kotlin. I am using khttp dependency to make client call (3rd party calls). It works fine with Java 11 as reflections are not restricted in Java 11, but this is not the same case with Java 17. I am facing the below error when I am using khttp.get() : Initially I fixed the build issue by adding jvmArgument to maven-surefire & maven plugin dependecy in my pom.xml like below: However, I am still unable to use my khttp.get methods as the VM options are not being applied to it. How do I allow reflections to make my khttp.get() calls not in my local but on the server PS: running with Java commands is not what I am looking for.
