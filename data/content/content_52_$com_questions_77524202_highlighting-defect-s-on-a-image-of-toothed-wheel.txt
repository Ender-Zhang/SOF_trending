I'm working on a project where I need to find out if image (toothed wheel) is OK or NOK. It is determined by minimum possible defect (in pixels) of teeth. So far I wrote code which will find the centre of the toothed wheel. From this point given by (x, y) I can "draw" a circle which radius is given as (radius of the toothed wheel - defect given by pixels). Image of OK toothed wheel Image of NOK toothed wheel I can then extract everything so there are just teeth left. Then I can count them and say that if this value is lower than 19 (which is the number of teeth that toothed wheel have) then its NOK. Otherwise it is OK. Circle with prescribed radius Extracted teeth My problem now is that I need to highlight these defects on the original image - something like this: Highlighted defects I have no clue how to do that and would appreciate any help with this problem. I have this code so far:
