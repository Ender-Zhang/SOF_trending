I am trying to get down to a completely unstyled AreaChart using JavaFX . I want nothing but the actual graph line. So far I think I have achieved this accept for this annoying white line that appears along the bottom of the graph. Does anyone know how to remove this? Update: Adding this under .chart in the css file seems to have removed the line. Adding this under '.chart' in the 'css' file seems to have removed the line.
