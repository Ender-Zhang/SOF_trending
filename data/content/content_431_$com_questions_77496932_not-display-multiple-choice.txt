I have a script Im working on for Google sheets. I want it to only display a multiple choice if the ticket is open and not display if the ticket is closed. What I am getting is it will not display the Value but have a blank option to select. Any idea how to remove the option? This is as far as I can get it to go so far I believe your goal is as follows. You want to retrieve the rows that column "C" which has a value of "Open", and you want to create the values using columns "A" and "F" from the retrieved rows. And, you want to put the values into the existing multiple-choice item in a Google Form. The argument of the method setChoiceValues of Class MultipleChoiceItem is String[] . So, in your situation, I thought that an array including your expected values could be used. When this is reflected in your script, how about the following modification? Modified script: Note: In this modification, it supposes that your item ID and form ID are valid values. Please be careful about this. From TicketArray[i] = theTickets[i][0] + 'XXX'; , if you want to use this value when column "C" has no value of "Open", please modify the above script as follows. From To References: setChoiceValues(values) - filter() map()
