In spring framework 6.1, a new synchronous HTTP client RestClient was introduced. See also: https://github.com/spring-projects/spring-framework/issues/29552 It aims to replace the existing RestTemplate . In Spring Boot, there was a TestRestTemplate which could be used for integration tests. See also: https://docs.spring.io/spring-boot/docs/current/reference/html/features.html#features.testing.utilities.test-rest-template However, I could not find any mention of a variant for RestClient . What is the recommended way to do integration testing using RestClient ? There's no test variant of RestClient . This Spring Framework issue is tracking a RestClient equivalent of WebClient 's WebTestClient .
