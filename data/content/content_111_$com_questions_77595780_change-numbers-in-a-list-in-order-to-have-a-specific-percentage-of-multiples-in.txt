I'm trying to create a complicated program in Python. There are 9 prime numbers that I want to use (2,3,5,7,11,13,17,19,23). I want to generate a list of 100 number so that exactly 99 of them are a multiple of 2, exactly 98 of them are a multiple of 3 and so on... I have no strategy on how to implement this because all the numbers have to change accordingly to each other which makes things very complicated. If the list is generated correctly, the following code should output: Output: Anyone know how to do this? EDIT: I'm trying to get the fraction of the numbers that is divisible by all of the prime numbers multiplied together. The goal is to get this fraction as small as possible. One problem is that although 91 of the numbers are multipliers of 23, not necessarily all of them are a multiple of 2. This ensures you have 100 distinct values with no repeats that will get you exactly what you need. You can run this to check that the counts match up. You're overthinking this.  Just start out with an array of 1s.  Now skip the first and multiply the rest by 2.  Skip the first 2 and multiply the rest by 3.  Skip the first 3, and multiply the rest by 5. This only creates 10 distinct values -- the final 90 are repeated.  That satisfies your requirement, but if you want distinct values. you could just make the rest multiples. Just initialise your 100 numbers at 1 , then choose 99 numbers to multiply by 2, then 98 numbers to multiply by 3, etc. To choose randomly, use random.sample .
