I have a problem while using HaarCascades to detect a face in the photo. I get this error: Here is my function: It happens only sometimes (not for all images). What can I do? The failed assertion was: (-215:Assertion failed) scaleFactor > 1 && _image.depth() == CV_8U in function 'detectMultiScale' Both conditions must be true. At least one of them was false. The scale factor needs to be larger than 1. Your code reduces it below that. Your code also calls detectMultiScale() repeatedly on the same image, with varying scale factors. That is unreasonable. Pick a scale factor that is suitably close to 1, then run detection only once. 1.3 may be too big a step. Try 1.2 or 1.1 . Don't go too close or it'll just waste time for no practical gain.
