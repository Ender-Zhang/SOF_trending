I am working with the Jupyter Notebook of chapter 15 of the Hands-On Machine Learning with Scikit-Learn, Keras & TensorFlow book by Aurélien Géron (Third Edition). I encountered an error in cell 43 of the notebook. It's in the paragraph Multivariate time series . The original code is the following: The error: I use a MacBook Pro with M1 Max processor. I don't know if that produces the error. How to resolve this?
