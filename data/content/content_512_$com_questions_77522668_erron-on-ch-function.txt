Quoth the MDN : HTMLTableCellElement.ch (Deprecated) A string containing one single character. This character is the one to align all the cell of a column on. It reflects the char and default to the decimal points associated with the language, e.g. '.' for English, or ',' for French. This property was optional and was not very well supported. In other words, when in an inline event handler for a table cell element, you end up trying to call a string as a function. The fix is to name ch() something else (or to refer to it as e.g. window.ch() if you can't rename it).
