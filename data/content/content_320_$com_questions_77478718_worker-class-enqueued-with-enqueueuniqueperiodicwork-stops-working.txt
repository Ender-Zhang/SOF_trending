I have a Worker class - public class UpdatePushRegistration extends Worker which I enqueue using When I run in the debugger and leave my laptop running, it seems to be working fine. when I run on my phone (either by copying the APK or by publishing through the store) it runs a number of times, sometimes as low as 2, and then stops (I write to a cloud based log). I tried this on two different phone models. Any idea why this would stop or how to troubleshoot? Any idea why this would stop or how to troubleshoot? Probably because it's a long running worker, in such case the documentation provides Support for long-running workers which runs a foreground service on your behalf to execute the WorkRequest . This requires to call startForeground() to update the notification associated with the foreground service: These APIs allow developers to specify that this WorkRequest is
important (from a user perspective) or long-running. The documentation offers a Java sample for that case. And this answer also has another Kotlin example.
