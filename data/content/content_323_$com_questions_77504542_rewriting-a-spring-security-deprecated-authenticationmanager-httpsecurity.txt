I've read some examples and docs on Spring security which i managed to rewrite a deprecated function on the SecurityFilterchain. https://docs.spring.io/spring-security/site/docs/current/api/org/springframework/security/config/annotation/SecurityConfigurerAdapter.html#and() However in another function below im facing issue on not knowing how i can rewrite it in a lambda based configuration and would need help to rewrite this. Instead of using AuthenticationManagerBuilder , please publish the UserDetailsService and PasswordEncoder beans separately like so: In your case, given that you are fine with the AuthenticationProvider defaults in AuthenticationManager , there is no need to construct one directly as you are doing. You could rewrite AuthenticationManager Bean as next one it is going to work as expected. More details about it and some references you will be able to find spring-security-without-the-websecurityconfigureradapter post.
