I tried looking into the systrace in Perfetto UI but just couldn't figure out the reason for crash. The logs for the crashes showed multiple calls related to the G.C so suspected it to be a memory leak and used LeakCanary to look for memory leaks. I'm fixing the memory leaks one by one. Just wanted to know if I'm heading in the right direction or not. This is the crash that I'm getting Here is the LeakCanary report com.myapp.chat.InboxActivity instance â€‹     Leaking: YES
(ObjectWatcher was watching this because com.myapp. InboxActivity is leaking.  Insufficient data to tell why it's leaking from what you posted, I would look for what references to it are outstanding. InboxActivity received the Activity.onDestroy() callback, it should be garbage collected but cannot be because it is held in memory ("leaking"). It is held in memory by android.app.LoaderApk.mReceivers . LoaderApk is an internal class of the Android framework. It keeps the list of broadcast receivers currently registered in an ArrayMap in mReceivers This means InboxActivity implements BroadcastReceiver , and somewhere in the code you're doing Context.registerReceiver(inboxActivity) but forgetting to do Context.unregisterReceiver(inboxActivity) when the activity is destroyed. That's what you need to fix to make the leak go away.
