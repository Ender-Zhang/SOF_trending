After upgrading from Spring 5.3.21 to 6.0.13 and updating java 12 to 17, we're getting errors on all our services like this one below. I could not find any other posts around the internet pointing in any direction. We include / pull in dependencies (xxx-3.4.5-SNAPSHOT.jar) from other repositories. Those are build using the same maven parent, so versions all are the same. Not sure what more I can include. Just some suggestions on how to further investigate would be great. I'm really stuck atm and don't know a way forward. I tried to find out what version of Spring could cause this. Did a complete clean of the environment (rm ~/.m2/repository and target). I also tried to create a new minimal service from scratch, but ran into the same issue once I include the dependencies.
