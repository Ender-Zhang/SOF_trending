In the DevTools console of Chrome (version 63), I typed the following: Notice the extra asterisk in the second query. Both queries find the same element, but the second one is clearly getting a slightly different result. Also I wouldn't have expected the asterisk to be legal. Can someone explain what effect the asterisk is having? Note that this is not just asking about the use of an asterisk in a query, but about its effect when immediately next to an identifier. Okay, thanks to the comments above, I understand what was happening. #right means find the element with an id of 'right'. It will never return more than one element. *#right means find any element with an id of 'right', in the same way as div#right means find any div with that id. It will return more than one element if there are more than one elements with that id. (There shouldn't be, but Chrome at least lets you do this.) * #right means find the element with an id of 'right' that is also a descendant of another element. It will also return more than one element if there are more than one elements with that id. Although the last case might seem redundant, it wouldn't match anything if the 'html' element was the only one that had an id of 'right'. The asterisk stands for any element. #right and *#right should both return the same element, since an id is unique.
