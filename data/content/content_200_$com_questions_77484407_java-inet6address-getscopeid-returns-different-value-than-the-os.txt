I wrote a little utility that prints adapter information, similar to ifconfig on Linux. It uses Inet6Address.getScopeId(). This is the output it produces: The scope id is 2 for the adapter and 1 for the loopback adapter. But when I run ifconfig (Ubuntu 22.04), I get: ifconfig prints a different scope id and als a different scope name. It looks like the numbers I get using ip6.getScopeId() are matching the adapter index (derived via ip6.getScopedInterface().getIndex()). The name I get using ip6.getScopedInterface().getName() matches the actual adapter name.
Where does "link" and "host" come from? Any ideas?
