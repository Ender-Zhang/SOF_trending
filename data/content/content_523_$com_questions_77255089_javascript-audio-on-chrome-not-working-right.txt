I'm making a webpage that plays a random sound every time you load the webpage, and having problems with the Audio element in JS. I can't get my browser to play sound and I don't know what to do. It may be something dumb that I missed but I'm fairly certain that I did it right. At first, my code was as follows. I wanted it to play a random note: I tried it, and it didn't work. Next, I tried a longer route for my play() function: Again, it didn't work. Please help, I don't know what I'm doing wrong. "I used a function that played the sound on a button click and it didn't work." There are two possibilities that come to mind: The button isn't registered/bound to the "click" event. The button has a bad inline event handler. This type of event handler is not recommended . Of course we can't be sure since HTML wasn't included in the question. Please familiarize oneself with events and event delegation . In the example below, an I mmediately I nvoked F unction E xpression is used since it's only needed once at page load. Details are commented in example.
