I tried to train a XGBoost model using GPU acceleration.
When training my model using gridsearch, I get the following warning: UserWarning: [17:29:04] WARNING:
/workspace/src/common/error_msg.cc:58: Falling back to prediction
using DMatrix due to mismatched devices. This might lead to higher
memory usage and slower performance. XGBoost is running on: cuda:0,
while the input data is on: cpu. Potential solutions: Use a data structure that matches the device ordinal in the booster. Set the device for booster before call to inplace_predict. Although some potential solutions are given, I'm not sure how to interpret them and what to do with this information.
Surprisingly, it only appears when using GridSearchCV.
In my minimal example below, I do not get the warning if I use reg directly instead of gs . My X and y variables come from hdf5 files that I read using pandas.
Can anybody give me a hint on how I might improve my code to not raise the warning? packages:
