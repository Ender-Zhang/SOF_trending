I want to change the text for an item variably. to do this, i tried to update the menu using update_menu(). unfortunately, this didn't work and i couldn't find anything more detailed in the pystray documentation. I hope you can help me. thank you. I've got to a similar problem earlier, I wanted to update the submenu while running. I made a version for what you wanted to adjust: The MenuItem takes (*items) so giving it a list with items in a lambda function works to update it later. You have to alter the menu_items list to your needs and update. Couldn't figure out tho how to just adjust the text, with a lambda e.g. either. Found also this example #17 , they changed the whole menu each time, but well... UPDATE: Here's what you wanted, cleaner than my previous answer: found here
