I want to add a comment while debugging, but it seems to change the line numbers. Then, I added a white breakpoint instead of red. I found a lot of answers about visual studio , but it's hard to find vscode. Is it possible to edit code while debugging in vscode? You can use the Edit and Continue feature to do this. This feature allows you to change your code while the debugger is paused and continue debugging without restarting the program. To enable Edit and Continue , check this discussion: Is there a way to *completely* disable Edit and Continue?
