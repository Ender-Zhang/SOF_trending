Here is the problem - I want to see full traces linked for my flow which includes redirects and during this redirect traces lost. I use quarkus + opentelemetry. In the middle sometimes I have ui part which is not always mine so I could pass traceparent or any other values with cookies. Redirect is made by another service to which we send request and can not control. Libs used inside: What I've tried already is to create @ServerRequestFilter with higher priority and move from cookie to header traceparent -> it didn't help. Couldn't find how to correctly create parent span from traceparent . UPDATE:
Found how to link 2 spans but it seems it works not as I expected It creates new span to main trace flow and attaches to it -> and then I have still separate trace which I wanted to link with all needed tags. Any suggestions?
