this is my first ever post on StackOverflow, so I hope I'm doing it correctly. Thanks in advance! I'm refactoring a file uploading function to an Async file uploading function.
I am able to create a traileroffer,then with another POST request I can upload images to it. If I restart the application everything is uploading successfully 100% of the time. After any type of request, the image uploading fails, sometimes a couple will go through successfully. The main issue is, it seems that the files which are uploaded are empty / the file size is <= 0. I'm not sure what's going wrong but before I refactor my entire (working) function I'd like to check if this may be a project based thing or if it's more complicated than that. The reason I think my post differentiates others is that my function/code is probably fine, but it may be something in my project setup instead. I hope someone experienced something similar like me and knows what may be the cause. Though, it may be my code/function because before I refactored to Asynchronous, it did work fine. Successfull logs: Error logs: To summarize. We're uploading the images to google cloud services, then saving that into our database. Not everything's perfect but it's doing the job for now and if I do a successfull upload it also shows in our front end as it should. I hope you can give me some possible solutions! I tried to find out where the multipart file went empty/size 0. Which is the moment we enter the uploadImagesAsync function. I don't know how, or why. But I expected it to go wrong at the postman request part. What weirded me out is that the when I tried several times, sometimes 1 out of 4 images would successfully upload but the others would not. And that, if I restart the project it actually works quite well. My postman setup is quite simple. It's a form-data with "coverImage" with 1 picture and "images" with 3 pictures.
