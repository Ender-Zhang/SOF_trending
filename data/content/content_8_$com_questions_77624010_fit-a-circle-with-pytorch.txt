How to construct a network such that the input is a coordinate on a cross-section circle and the output is the sum of the squares of that coordinate.inputs=[x,y,1]ï¼Œoutputs=[square(x)+square(y)] I made a network with one hidden layer, but it has very high losses and is almost impossible to fit. To improve the convergence of your code, you can do these suggestions: Scale you input data into a similar range using min-max scaling or standardization: Increase num_epochs : Change batch_size : I run your code with the above changes, and it converges. Hope this helps.
