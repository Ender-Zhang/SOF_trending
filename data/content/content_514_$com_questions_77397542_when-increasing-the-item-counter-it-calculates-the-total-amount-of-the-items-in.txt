I'm working on a React project and using the useReducer hook to manage my state. I have a specific issue with updating the fixed price for my items. In my code, I'm trying to increment the quantity of items in the shopping cart, and with each increment, I want to add the fixed price to the total price. However, I'm facing a problem where the fixed price keeps updating constantly. Here's my code: The issue I'm experiencing is that the newPrice variable appears to update continuously when I increment the item quantity. My goal is to add the fixed price to the total price with each increment of the item counter. Issue The INCREMENT reducer case is also updating the order price, each time doubling it. Solution Computing a total value from some quantity and cost value is often considered derived state and it's a bit of a React anti-pattern to store derived state in state. If you must compute and store a total price value in state then I suggest leaving the unit price alone and add a new total property to the state for the computed value. Example: However, as I stated, computing a total and storing it in the state is a React anti-pattern. Just update the item quantity and compute the derived item total when rendering. Example:
