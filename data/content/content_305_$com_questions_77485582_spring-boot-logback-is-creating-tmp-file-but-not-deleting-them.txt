I'm having problem with my Logback in Java/Spring Boot application. My Logback is keep creating large tmp files and it's taking over lots of disk usage. This is how my RollingFileAppender in logback-config.xml looks like I'm aware that TimeBasedRollingPolicy rolls file every 00:00 in my option. I've seend that %i option is needed for rolling index, and I tried it but %i option is not available in TimeBasedRollingPolicy and it's only used is SizeAndTimeBasedRollingPolicy . Why is my logback keep creating large tmp files? Let me know if you need anymore information. Thank you. ps. I know I can solve this issue by using SizeAndTimeBasedRollingPolicy and %i option, but I'm curious why this options is keep creating big tmp files. Let see why the problem is : You did not specify any timeBasedFileNamingAndTriggeringPolicy inside rollingPolicy How we can fix it : We can set a triggering police for every 5 mb size file can be archive to another folder consider below sample rollingPolicy to avoid large log file sample rollingPolicy
