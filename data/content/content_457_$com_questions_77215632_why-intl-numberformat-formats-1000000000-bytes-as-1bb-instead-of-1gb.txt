I am trying to configure my Intl.NumberFormat instance to show a proper unit for large amounts but seems like it shows B instead of G for 1000000000, e.g. 1BB/s instead of 1GB/s. Here is my instance: Why is it so? My browser is the latest Chrome on MacOS. Here's a workaround which checks the size of the number and picks an appropriate unit. The issue seems to be with Intl itself. as your code in your question produces 1BB/s if you change the unitDisplay to be long instead, you will get "1B bytes per second" in the console, like meaning that the the issue is with the format function Test 1 after some testing. I've discovered that. passing value of 1000000000 the output is "1B bytes per second" (which you originaly passing in as per your question) 100000000 the output is "100M bytes per second" if we change the unitDisplay back to narrow Test 2 and if we run the same test again, we get passing value of 1000000000 the output is "1BB/s" (which you originaly passing in as per your question) 100000000 the output is "100MB/s" Solution the issue is that the B refers to billion so the output is correct but it does not give billion bytes per second in the long unit display setting, so its not broken but rather, just badly implemented, with values so large it simple just uses 1B meaning 1 billion
