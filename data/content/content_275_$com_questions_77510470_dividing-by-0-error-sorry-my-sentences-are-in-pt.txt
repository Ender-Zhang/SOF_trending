I'm pretty new to this programming area, I'm taking a level 5 course and I'm learning java now. I was trying to do some exercises at home, and now I'm trying to build an algorithm that let's the user choose (N) number of numbers, and then randomly display them and make the average of all the negatives, and the percentage of all the positive ones. But there's this error with my counter, says it can't divide by 0, I even tried to initialize it as 1, and before I do the math I take -1 from him to come to it's original value, but it won't work. Would appreciate some enlightnment here! Thanks alot! Your code seems mostly correct, but there's a small issue in your for loop condition. The loop should continue while i is less than N , not while i == N-1 . The correct loop condition is i < N . Here's the corrected code: These changes should help you avoid the divide-by-zero error and provide more accurate results. I also added some checks to handle cases where there are no negative or positive numbers entered by the user.
