What I have: I have a BorderPane, my BorderPane consists of 2 parts, top and center. Inside top part I have ImageView which i want to set and inside center part I have a pane in which I have a button and this button should change the image inside ImageView. The BorderPane as a whole is one FXML file controlled with BorderPaneController but the center part (pane) is another FXML file controlled wtih CenterPaneController. What I want to do:
The imageview show my new image after i click the button What is my problem: When I click the button the image path is successfuly transfered from CenterPaneController to BorderPaneController and also the ImageView is successfuly set, because it contains the image path but the Image View is still empty this is the FXML file of the center part (pane) of the BorderPane where I have the button: this is the FXML file of the BorderPane where I have my ImageView in the top part: code of my BorderPaneController: This is the code of my CenterPaneController:
