Hello , iam making reactjs cv builder project , but i recognized that its illogical to write the code like this and there must be a shorter and cleaner way that i dont know about , i would appreciate any help of any kind , Thanks . github repo : https://github.com/abdhazouri00/cv There are various third-party "form" hooks for doing this sort of thing, so you might search for one of those. Otherwise, the React documentation shows almost exactly this situation, as an example of when it would be reasonable to put an object in state and update individual parts of it rather than multiple discrete state elements. But their example still has individual functions for each input, which may not be useful in your situation. Instead, you can use the name property of the form field and a single handler. Here's the React documentation example updated to do that: You could go even further and generate the form fields from the object (you'd add some labelling information) rather than having to write out each field in the code. That can be helpful, or can be an over-abstraction depending on the situation.
