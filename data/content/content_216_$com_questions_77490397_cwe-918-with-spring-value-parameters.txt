After running a code scanning on my project, I see the CWE-918 vulnerability, but in the code, the parameters are retrieved from application.properties , so I am unsure how to solve this issue or even if it is an actual issue. This is the code: application.properties file: Then the config class where the scanner detects the vulnerability: The line where the vulnerability is detected is this one: I tried looking for info about CWE-918 and to find possible fixes, one of the solutions proposed is to place those values in the code as constants, but I don't think that hardcoding the value of properties as proxy host and port is a good idea. You didn't provide too many details about the supposed vulnerability, but from afar, this looks like a false positive. If these properties are read from a configuration file that the end-user (and thus, also the attacker) can't access, there is no vulnerability here. To state it differently - if an attacker needs to gain access to a local file on your server in order to change these values, the fact that they're able to do so once gaining such access is the least of your concerns.
