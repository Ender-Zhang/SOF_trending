This question already has answers here : Why do we assign a parent reference to the child object in Java? (12 answers) Closed 26 days ago . I have 4 classes How I redesign this to make like this without using instanceof or casting like Redesign the classes to allow call of the BankAccount methods without using instanceof or casting using design patterns or add more classes any approach. You cannot.  There is no way to do this.  Only something of type BankAccount -- which would have to be cast to it -- can have getAccountNumber() called on it. In the simple case you can add an abstract method to the parent class. This makes an accountNumber property to be abstract. Every non-abstract subclass should implement the abstract method of Account class. Then you can use without using instanceof or casting like This is allowed because abstract methods can use polymorphism . Another way is to use interface to access the property of some subclass. Another subclass might not implement this interface if it doesn't have such property. When you need to access the property then you upcast to the interface without instanceof . Then you can use Technically, you shouldn't expect Account to have a getAccountNumber method. Try the following.
