I am trying to extract the text using Xclass that follows the bolded politicians name in the below code. I am able to extract the politicians name and URL to their profile, but how would I go about pulling the text that follows? In the code below, I'm trying to extract it using: I've tried a million other things, but to no avail. For example on the website it says: " Corey Stapleton (R), former Montana Secretary of State, announced his candidacy on November 11, 2022.[35] Stapleton withdrew from the race on October 13, 2023" I want to pull the text after Corey Stapleton. There is an a href tag embedded inside a bold tag and the text follows. I don't see any choice than to get the parents and parse the text. You can get the parents by doing: This will find all bold anchors/links and go up two levels (so up to <b> and then their parent). You then have to parse their resulting text content. You can't find it using following-sibling because that text is not a sibling element (with a tag of its own) I found a simpler way to do this. I also streamlined the rest of your code. The XPath below will return the desired elements in one pass. That returns a list of the filtered LIs that contain the text you want. From there, you can grab the name, URL, and party (I used regex). The final code: Output:
