Closed last month . Improve this question I have a list of pdf files and I want to analyze the first page of each document to extract information. I've tried a lot of free and paid OCR, but in my case, the results aren't good enough. So I want to try using the ChatGPT API in python. How do I go about it? Also, I saw in [openAI Vision documentation] ( https://platform.openai.com/docs/guides/vision ) that there is a detail parameter but there is no example provided, how do I use this parameter? Firstly, you need to extact the first page of each document as image (here PNG). Then, to call ChatGPT API you need to convert this image in base64 . Finally, you can call ChatGPT API (with the detail parameter). Note that the parameter detail can be low or high (see the documentation ). Here is an example of a full workflow. EDIT: In terms of price , I tried it on the first page of a pdf, the png was 596x842 pixels, the request (question + image) cost me 98 Input tokens and 87 Output tokens. With the current pricing of $0.01 / 1K Input tokens and $0.03 / 1K Output tokens, that's a total of $0.00359 ($3.59/1K images).
