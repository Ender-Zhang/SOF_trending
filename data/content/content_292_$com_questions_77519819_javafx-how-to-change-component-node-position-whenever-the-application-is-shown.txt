I'm writing a program that when it's started one of the anchorpane's is opened at the cursor position. I've made it with a method, which is called in the initialize(), and it's working fine. The problem is that, in the main, when i hide the primaryStage, or close it, and i instantiate an stage again to be shown, it won't get the cursor position anymore, and the UI keeps appearing in the same position as the first time. It's like the Controller keeps running. Somebody knows why does it happens? And how can i solve this?
There's a way i can change the position in the controller whenever the anchorPane is started or visible? Or stop that which keeps running? A solution that keeps it open would be better for performance. I'm using Jnativehook to call it, and scenebuilder.
Thanks. JDK 21 , JAVAFX 21.0.1 , JNativeHook 2.2.2 . Main: Controller: Utils: FXML: module-info: is a static member -> that will only be set when the Utils class is first loaded. Use a static method in Utils instead: That will get you the current cursor location whenever you call it.
