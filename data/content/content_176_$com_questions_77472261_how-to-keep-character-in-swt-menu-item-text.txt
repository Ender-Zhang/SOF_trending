I built a Java application using SWT and JFace (on Windows). Here I would like to put an email address as text in a menu item and use the following action class: and of course: What confuses me a bit is that when the menu is displayed, the "at" character is missing and a space is shown in its place instead. Can I somehow keep the @ character? I've already tried putting a double backslash in front of the @ character or replacing the @ character with the Unicode notation \u0040 - neither of which helped. This appears to be the "accelerator" text handling in the Action code which converts anything following a tab or @ if there is no tab to a separate part of the menu. Since the code first looks for a tab before it looks for @ using: seems to work. You could also use \uFF20 "large commercial @" or \uFE6B "small commercial @" if the font being used supports them. Alternatively just using Menu , MenuItem and listeners rather than MenuManager also  works.
