I am currently doing a YouTube downloader using tkinter, customtkinter, and pytube3. After creating the code it doesn't download neither video or audio. Im basically new to python and tkinter, i would like to know how i can make the app work. Here is the code. I tried using tkinter and customtkinter docs as well as basic tutorials but nothing i tried from the docs or the tutorials fixed it. By what i understand, something in the try fails and it prints "couldnt download".
