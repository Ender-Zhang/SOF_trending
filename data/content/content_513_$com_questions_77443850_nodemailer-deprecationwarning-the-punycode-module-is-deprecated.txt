I need to create a script that send a mail once a day using a gmail account. I've used nodemailer and I have this simple test code I've noticed that I will always get this error when I try to run the script using node index.js Is there any problem into the code or it's a nodemailer bug?Is there any alternative? I just ran into the same issue. You need to downgrade your Node Version to 20.9.0.
