Hazelcast creates a client in discovery mode kubernetes_api that tries to connect in an infinite loop and blocks the app start I created a hazelcast instance with version 5.3.6 and set discovery strategy to dns_lookup the cluster starts perfectly using this discovery mode but then a client is launched hz.client1 [dev] using kubernetes_api as discovery mode, and it gets stucked as i have no RBAC,  and it is unable to get live cluster connection
How can I use also dns_lookup for this client? I tried to create a bean ClientConfigand set strategy to dns_lookup but it still tries to connect using kubernetes_api See hazelcast log creating hazelcast cluster See hazelcast log with cluster up See client trying to connect the kubernetes API
