I have created a neural network for my data which has 4 parameters as input and 1 output. I want to optimize the output with pso but I get an error while compiling the code. I use the model.predict as the objective function. I used this function for genetic algorithm and I didn't have any problem. enter image description here enter image description here I want to get the optimum points from pso
