I'm trying to practice with react routing, so I made this little web app based on geography. First I set up the router paths: Here is the starting page: But when I click on Europe, the url changes in the address bar, but I don't see the Europe component, which looks like this: Instead it just seems to stay on the World component. What's the deal? <Route path="/" element={<World />}> ... </Route> is a layout route with nested routes, World necessarily should render an Outlet for the nested routes to render their element content into. The same goes for Europe and the layout route it is rendered as. Update the World and Europe layout route components to render Outlet components for their nested children routes.
