This is a spock test using groovy This is my code I have a groovy test in the structure of However when I run the test, service itself is null. Is there an issue with my configuration/injection? I'm trying to define the bean within the test file. In the groovy with spock tests you should use @SpringBean to create and inject mocks into application context Using @SpringBean Registers mock/stub/spy as a spring bean in the test context. To use @SpringBean you have to use a strongly typed field def or Object wonâ€™t work. You also need to directly assign the Mock/Stub/Spy to the field using the standard Spock syntax. You can even use the initializer blocks to define common behavior, however they are only picked up once they are attached to the Specification. @SpringBean definitions can replace existing Beans in your ApplicationContext.
