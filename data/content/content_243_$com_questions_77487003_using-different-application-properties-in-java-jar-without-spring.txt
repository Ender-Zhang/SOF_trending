I have to deploy a simple .jar file in a production environment. For security reasons, I'm not able to write production credentials inside the application.properties . I retrieve properties like so: Since the .jar contains /application.properties at its root directory, it will be read correctly. I need to outsource this application.properties and I was wondering if there was a way simply by adding a parameter for the java -jar App.jar command. I only found parameters for a Spring project ( here ), which are not for me because this .jar is plain JDBC Java. I would like to avoid using a FileInputStream and giving the file path as parameter, like so: And then launching the .jar with java -jar App.jar /path/to/application.properties .. But I will, if there are no other options. The solution I adopted is copying the external application.properties inside the .jar file, using this command: Works flawlessly.
