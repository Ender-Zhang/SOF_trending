I have a mapping where I am trying to read serialized messages in Json format from Kafka topic in informatica PowerCenter and process to flat file. However, when I run the workflow, it reads messages which I can see in monitor and could not write to flat file it shows 0 records on targets and workflow succeeded.  Below is the mapping. code: Does this code convert the serialized data into Json and Informatica able to read?
