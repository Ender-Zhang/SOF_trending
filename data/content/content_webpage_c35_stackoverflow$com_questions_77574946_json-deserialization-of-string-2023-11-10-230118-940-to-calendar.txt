I am trying to deserialize json String date to Calendar and deserialization is working however it is not what i want. Current Behaviour Deserializes to responseDateTime=java.util.GregorianCalendar[time=1141556400000,areFieldsSet=true,areAllFieldsSet=true,lenient=true,zone=sun.util.calendar.ZoneInfo[id="UTC"..... . I want a Simple Calendar Date of the format yyyy-MM-dd HH:mm:ss.SSS You should been using LocalDateTime property in code.
eg: output: final: tl;dr Details Not enough information. Your input represents a date and a time of day but lacks the context of an offset or time zone. So you cannot parse directly as a Calendar . Also, Calendar is a terribly flawed obsolete legacy class. Parse your input as a LocalDateTime after replacing the SPACE in the middle with a T to comply with ISO 8601 standard. I want a Simple Calendar Date of the format yyyy-MM-dd HH:mm:ss.SSS Date-time objects are not text. They do not have a format.
