But you need to take into account SamplingFrom and SamplingTo . That is, if SamplingFrom == LithIntervalFrom , then we begin to assign values ​​exactly from the line where these variables are equal. Also if 'LithIntervalFrom' = 12, and 'LithIntervalTo' = 20, then we will need to bind all gold values ​​that are in this interval. This is what the result should look like with the data above:
