I have been experimenting with TensorFlow.js in a node.js application. I have a dataset of 8000 images I am using for training, and I ran into some memory limitations. I am trying to set up my program such so that it saves the model after X number of iterations, so if (when) it runs out of memory at least I have saved the results of some of the run. If I define 6 epochs, it should run 3, save where it's at, and then continue training. It will run for the first 3, save the model, but then when it passes over 'history' something isn't right and it errors out. The error is in the validateModel function, where it's trying to access the .acc property of the history object but it's not there so it stops. Logging the model before and after, it drops the properties even though it just loaded in the model it just saved. Initially I was compiling the model during every iteration of the for loop, but I added an if statement that should only compile it once. I get the same error afterwards, and from the log I can see that it is just not retaining the learning from the previous epochs. I've messed with scope of the history variable, removing layers, reducing batch size and different ones of those parameters, have not been able to get it to continue after a save point. I am using the rsmprop optimizer. Thanks in advance, I'm at my wits end trying to get this to work. This is the log output: Here is my training endpoint and variable declarations:
