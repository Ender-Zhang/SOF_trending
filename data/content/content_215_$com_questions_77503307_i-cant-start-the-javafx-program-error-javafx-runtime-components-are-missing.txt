I created a project in Intellij Idea, included the javafx libraries in file > project structure > +. then added VM options to run > edit configurations > modify options. but even so I get the error Error: JavaFX runtime components are missing, and are required to run this application. fix?( https://i.stack.imgur.com/WuEkb.png )[error] ( https://i.stack.imgur.com/kqLG2.png )[vm options]
( https://i.stack.imgur.com/L96Fz.png )[path] I tried to recreate the project, but the result was the same. how to fix it? Donâ€™t add libraries manually. Edit POM for Maven to download, install, and bundle files Your screenshot shows your project is managed by Apache Maven . So edit that POM file to specify your JavaFX (OpenJFX) libraries. Copy-paste the dependency element from a repository such as this one . Maven will download, install, and bundle the OpenJFX files. Use JDK bundled with OpenJFX libraries Alternatively, install a JDK that comes bundled with the OpenJFX libraries. Then your app need not bundle. At least two of the several JDK vendors offer editions of their JDK products as a bundle: Azul Systems with ZuluFX (see blog post ) BellSoft with LibericaFX Read the documentation at https://OpenJFX.io/ Let IntelliJ create project Tip: Create your project using the JavaFX template provided by IntelliJ. See the manual .
