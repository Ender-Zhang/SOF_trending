Improve this question I am using a library awslimitchecker whose source code is in GitHub. I have forked the repo and add some modification. Now I would like to use my modified version in my script. I downloaded my repo in a subfolder. How can I refer to this library in my local folder? Thanks. I don't know why there is already 2 down votes on the question even before there is any answer for discussion. Sorry for the typo on "falked", but does it make the question less obvious? I turned to ChatGPT and pasted in the same question. Here is what I got: Navigate to Your Local Repository Folder: First, ensure that you are in the root directory of your local repository (the one you forked and downloaded). This directory should contain the setup.py file if the library is Python-based. Install Your Local Version of the Library: You can install your local version of the library directly using pip. Open your command line or terminal, navigate to the root directory of your local repository, and run: The -e flag is for "editable" mode, which means any changes you make to the local code will be reflected in the library without needing to reinstall it. Import the Library in Your Script: After installing, you can import and use your local version of the library in your Python scripts as usual. For example: Managing Dependencies: If you are managing your project dependencies using a requirements.txt file or similar, you might want to comment out the original awslimitchecker line in that file to avoid conflicts. Version Control: Keep your local repository up to date with the original repository by regularly pulling changes. This will help in avoiding conflicts and staying up-to-date with any important updates from the original source. Something worth thinking: Stackoverflow vs ChatGPT?
