I am reviewing some code written in tensorflow 1 that uses a neural network to modulate the weights of a second neural network. The code for the training loop (for every epoch) is the following: My question is, what exactly does the array in the first parameter of the sess.run function do? The first attribute of the array is the loss of the network (y - second net's output), the second is the output of the first net that modulates the second's weights, and the third is the AdamW optimizer. The documentation I found was really bad and I can't understand what exactly does the session.run function do with the "fetches" parameter apart from just training the model. The feed_dict is the training data input, output, learning rate and weight decay for the AdamW optimizer.
