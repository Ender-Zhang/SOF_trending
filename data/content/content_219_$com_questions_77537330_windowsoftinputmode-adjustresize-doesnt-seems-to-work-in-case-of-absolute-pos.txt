I have an EditText in the lower part of my Android screen as shown in image. Due to some project contraints I'm supposed to use only Absolute positioning. When clicked on the EditText the soft keyboard hides the EditText as shown in the other image. I have tried putting android:windowSoftInputMode="adjustResize" in the manifest file (also tried adjustPan)
It only works for relative positioning (commented textField_layoutparams code below) but doesn't seems to be working for absolute positioning. Even tried putting a ScrollView (commented code below) but it doesn't work. Code: Is there any way to achieve the desired behaviour in case of Absolute positioning? I think that issue generated when you tried to set EditText x and y from Kotlin side. the property android:windowSoftInputMode="adjustResize" into  in Manifest. that is work for all Android device, but in your case i noticed a difference when you set X and Y programmatically. You should try this one. i hope its work for you
