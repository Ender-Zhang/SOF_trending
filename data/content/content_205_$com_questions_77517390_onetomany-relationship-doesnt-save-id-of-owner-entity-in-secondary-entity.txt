Im trying to save in postgres 2 entities, Configuration and Screen . Configuration can have many Screens , then is oneToMany , and one Screen can have one Configuration , then is manyToOne . I'm using JPA to save those entities. The problem I have is, in Screen table, configuration_id relationship is not saved. That's my code: And this other when I create a new Configuration , I indicate the Screen that should be created except the 'id' field (it's configuration id created randomlly) The data is saved well, both in Configuration and Screen , except for that ( id_configuration ) field. There is a configuration_id field in Screen table, but it is always empty and never filled. Why is this happening? I'm indicating the cascade type ALL, and relationships are well-formed. Due to tutorials like: https://www.baeldung.com/hibernate-one-to-many I guess the problem in your model is mappedBy in @OneToMany . In your case it should point to class field which mapping this relation. So it should be: @OneToMany(mapped_by = "configuration", ...)
