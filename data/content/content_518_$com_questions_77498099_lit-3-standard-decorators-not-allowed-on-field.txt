The error thrown: Uncaught Error: Unsupported decorator location: field Example class using the Lit @queryDecorator for a field to query from the components shadow-dom. I have tried with/without the accessor . Setting the player =null for some sort of initialization. Babel is used in the project with what should be the proper plugin with specified version for standard decorator support. Using Babel Preset-Env as well. Maybe I have missed something in the Lit 3 documentation around this? Maybe something in the project build process isn't compatible while using rollup.
