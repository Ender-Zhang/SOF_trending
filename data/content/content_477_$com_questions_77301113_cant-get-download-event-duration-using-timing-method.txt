As mentioned in the title, I am trying to measure how much time a downloading event takes. I have referred to the documentation: https://playwright.dev/docs/api/class-request#request-timing to write the following lines of code. The download object is correctly created but I cant find the timing method which from my understanding own the duration of the downloading. Is there an other way to get the duration of a download using Playwright?
